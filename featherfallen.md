NEW BABEL /// PRELUDE 

LONGING FOR LOST MEMORY 

“Veil of light, I see through thee, 

I see through angels tainted by such a profane deity, 

I see through automata malevolent, 

And I see through God, so-called benevolent. 

I long for a world full of vibrance, 

Lurid vistas and bright cities, no violence, 

But dull, gray skies tower above these lands, 

Only outlived by eternal sands. 

Dear Dying World, you’ve met your doom, 

How I wait for you to heal your wounds, 

But who knows how long it will take, 

Or if you will at all, your blood is pooling into lakes. 

I’m not sure how much longer you’ll last, 

If the stains of war fade fast, 

If the jaws of the machine will ever close, 

Or if there ever is another blooming rose. 

 What a violent battle we’ve witnessed, 

Full of hardship, bloodshed, tears and all the rest, 

The earth draws near its final breath, 

And the only thing that can save it is death.” 

Charon, Angel of The Afterlife 

From ‘Lamentations of This World’ 

“You need not speak of it. Forget and repent, death bringer.” 

I swung my head back, gasping for air. Water flooded my lungs, and I coughed until I could breathe clearly. I panted, trying to catch my breath. Unnaturally clear azure water settled beneath me, the rocks of the river swaying with the ripples. As it stilled, I gazed at the person staring back. 

I didn’t recognize them. I was in an unfamiliar body. I steadily caught my breath, listening to the water running. Then, I looked at my hands. What looked like blood dripped from them, the scarlet liquid tainting the azure waters. I had no injuries anywhere on my body, it wasn’t my blood. I submerged my hands in the water, washing the crimson away.  

I sighed, bringing my hands to my face. Why were my hands bloodstained? Why couldn’t I remember anything? Where was I? – all questions I didn’t know the answer to. I wiped the water off my face as I caught my breath. I tried to remember my name, and my mind sorted through forgotten names until I caught the most important one. 

Azrael. 

My name was Azrael, but I had no clue what my name meant. One day, I knew I would understand again, but that day had yet to come. I stared back at my reflection and noted my features. 

I had large, curious eyes, with luminant yellow irises, burning like lanterns. My face was pale and dotted with freckles, my wet, black hair reaching to my shoulders. My bangs were of a lighter color than the rest of my hair; they were gray, from stress. To my sides were charcoal wings, with soft feathers. And above my head, a shattered, golden halo. 

I was an angel. I was a messenger of a god I didn’t know how to worship. Something representative of a forgotten trait. A creature of light, severed from the very thing that created me. I was worthless, and I served no real purpose. 

I stood up and examined my surroundings. I was at the shore of a river – an azure, beautiful river. The tides swept away the pebbles as the river ran calmly eastward – or what I assumed was east. My memory of directions was also fuzzy. The sky was gloomy and gray, matching the color of the stones. Past the river, dead trees towered above ashen grass, their few leaves gently falling. Then, past the trees were colossal walls, surrounding some sort of city with red clouds hanging above it like a disease. In the center of the city, there appeared to be a tower, bound by gargantuan chains. 

The Tower of Babel. 

All I could recall was its name. Nothing more, nothing less. It was oddly terrifying, its peak above the clouds, towering above all creation. 

I heard a rustle of leaves, and I glanced behind me. There, a stone altar, chiseled with engravings of gods unlike the one I was supposed to worship, gods of Greece. Next to the altar stood an angel. 

They had cerulean eyes, and cold-looking skin. Curly, white hair framed their face, reaching just past their ears, apart from two strips reaching halfway to their shoulders. They had wings with blue-tinted white feathers, resting at their sides. It was hard to say if they were male or female, but it was certain that they were impatiently waiting for something. 

“You look awfully disturbed,” the angel remarked, sitting on the altar and kicking their legs. 

“Who are you? Where am I? I... what do you want?” I replied. my voice trembling with fear and confusion. 

“What? Are you all right?” They asked, their grin immediately fading.  

“Who are you?” I repeated, a tinge of annoyance tainting my voice. 

They sighed, adjusting their clothes. They realized what had happened to me. “My name is Arael, and you are at the shore of the River Lethe. I am… was your friend.” 

“My friend? But... how can you be friends with a... murderer?” I asked, gazing down at my no longer bloodied hands. Wasn’t the Lethe in the underworld? Was I in Hades? 

“Huh? What are you talking about? You didn’t kill anyone, r-right?” Arael asked, their voice trembling. 

“There was blood on my hands... I deserve to be tortured, don’t I?” I replied. My self-deprecation was shining through. Four words rang in my skull, words I swore I had heard before. 

“Thou shalt not kill.” 

“Azrael, I don’t know whose blood that was, but... you must repent for this. I’m sorry, but... this is incredibly sinful. A-ask Sariel about this, please. I don’t know how to help,” Arael answered, shaking their head shamefully. 

“And... who’s Sariel? Are they like us? Angels?”  

Arael nodded, their hair swaying in the gentle zephyr. “Another once-friend of yours, The Angel of Execution. He’s just up the river, it’s not far. Good luck,” they said with a tearful wave. 

“G-goodbye. I’ll... let you know what he says, all right?” I responded, smiling softly as I waved goodbye.  

Who was I before I lost my memories? There were so many questions I wanted to ask, but I turned around anyways, turning towards the river. I started walking, adjusting my boots. As I walked, I now noticed the rest of my clothing. 

I wore a white shirt – buttoned and stained with blood. I wore shorts barely covering most of my thighs, which I thought was scandalous. I wore black leather boots with untied laces on my feet, with short, black socks. A choker was tightly wrapped around my neck, with the symbol of the messiah: a cross, dangling from it. But the messiah had yet to come, that I remembered. What did the cross mean? Was it truly representative of the messiah? 

My thoughts were interrupted by a voice behind me. 

“Azrael!” Someone exclaimed, their voice playful and oddly teasing. I spun my head around, turning towards the voice. 

 

A figure sat on a boulder, waving to me. One of his silver eyes was covered by a bandage and wore a choker akin to the one that I wore, but instead of a cross, there were three skulls. His wings weren’t feathered, but like the wings of a bat, with odd glowing argent patterns like the stars in the sky. His chestnut brown, almost reddish hair reached down to his shoulders, accompanied by two streaks of white, which fell in his pale face. His robes had many argent insignias and pins on them, and his halo was silver and intact. He was... oddly attractive, and he reminded me of the moon. 

“I’ve been waiting for you, you know,” he said, playing with a strand of his hair, curling it around his finger. 

“Sariel, right? I um... I have something I need to tell you,” I answered, sitting upon a smaller boulder. 

“Oh, look who’s being all bold! Go ahead, tell me. I’ve been eagerly waiting you to tell me this after all this time,” He replied, taking what I said entirely wrong.  

“I’m not confessing or anything!! I was going to tell you that I... I lost my memory of... really everything. I only know my name, pretty much,” I blurted out, barely even pausing to breathe. 

Sariel froze, his mouth hanging open for an agonizingly long second. “E-excuse me? Why? What?” 

“How am I supposed to know?! I don’t remember what I did, but there was blood on my hands, and I was told by Arael that you would help me repent. I don’t know, okay? I’m as confused as you are,” I snapped, fidgeting with the laces of my boots. 

“You... killed someone? Like an innocent human, who didn’t need to die yet? That’s... not like you, Azrael. I suppose I could help, though,” Sariel replied, retying his bandages at the back of his head. Sariel acted very strangely, almost as if he were hiding something. He expressed an abnormal amount of interest in me. 

“And... how do you plan on helping me, exactly?” I inquired, crossing my legs and messing with the cross choker. 

“Well, there is something I’ve been putting off on doing...” 

“Have you ever heard of a Watcher? Well... that was a dumb question, but you get the point. So, Watchers are fallen angels tainted by evil, and they’re quite hard to get rid of. I trust you can slay them!” Sariel exclaimed, grinning. 

“What?! Why choose me? I don’t know how to fight anymore!. How... how do you expect me to kill something like that?! Most angels on earth are strong, I think. That’s what I recall.” 

“Don’t worry, I’ll help you along your journey!” Sariel added, his smile growing like he was saying something that would really help me. 

“Like that’ll help!” I exclaimed, leaping off from the boulder. “And killing in the name of ‘repentance’ seems sacrilegious. How do I know you’re not joking with me?!” 

“Well, how else would you cleanse yourself? Pray? It’s been over two hundred years, Azrael. No miracles will come until the Messiah is born,” Sariel sighed, tossing a rock across the water. To my surprise, it skipped around four times – quite impressive. 

I sighed as well, tossing a stone too. It sank immediately, and I stomped the ground out of exasperation. “Who really are you anyways?! I heard you were the Angel of Execution, but how can a nickname like that belong to you? You look nothing like I’d expect Death to look like.” 

“It’s not just a sobriquet, Azrael. It’s a title I earned rightfully. When the last reaper retired, I trained for years to take his place. The moon chose me, dear. And look at me now. Sariel, The Angel of Execution – one of the most important angels of all time,” Sariel said, giggling to themself.  

“That really doesn’t help me. Who really are you?” 

Sariel grumbled. “As I said, my name is Sariel, and it is my duty to kill those who must be killed. It’s simple really. And as for our relationship, you used to be my mentor. Now, look at me. I’ve surpassed you,” Sariel teased with a sly smile. 

“Oh, shut up!! Just tell me more about what I need to do already!” I snapped, throwing a rock into the Lethe. The splash rang in my eardrums – a noise I remembered deep in my past. Maybe whoever I killed wasn’t the first, or... no, it didn’t matter. The splash of azure water rained mist upon me, and I sighed, calming myself. “Who are the Watchers? Which one do I need to get rid of first?” 

Sariel hesitated for a moment, closing his eyes as he exhaled softly. “Fine, I’ll tell you.” 

 

“You see that tower over there?” Sariel asked, pointing to the spire in the center of the city. “That is the Tower of New Babel, built when the last holy text was written. You see, a long time ago, the Second Watcher was chained in a deep cavern. Then, he built that city from the shadows over centuries through the collective urges of many. When they found out, the angels trapped him beneath the city. But he still has influence. You can find him in the center of the city, bound by holy chains.” 

“Second Watcher? Who’s the first?” I asked, staring at the pillar that pierced the clouds and tossing another rock into the river. 

Sariel paused for an uncomfortable moment. The only sound was the distant howling wind and the trickle of water. “We don’t talk about the First Watcher.” 

“Why not? What did he do that was so unspeakably evil?” I inquired innocently. 

I was given no answer. Sariel stared at the tides of the Lethe and glanced back over at me. “I’ll meet you in the city. Good luck.” 

And with that, Sariel leaped off the boulder, his bat-like wings folding inwards. He walked away into the forest, leaving me alone at the shores of the azure river. I still had no idea how many Watchers there were, or what I needed to do to kill any of them. It was so confusing. 

What kind of person was I before I lost my memory? Why did I lose my memory to begin with? Did I cleanse myself on purpose? 

 

I found myself crossing a bridge across and emerging into an ashen field. The grass was colorless and tall, reaching past my knees. Each blade swayed in the gentle breeze, which, judging from the gray skies above me, might not be gentle for much longer. The gates of the city stood high, trying to prevent me from entering. Black bars stretched the fifteen-meter entrance, and gargoyles vaguely resembling angels sat at the peaks of the spires. 

Red vines hung from intricate architecture, and flowers bloomed from the cracks in the door. Sariel was nowhere to be seen, but I saw someone else instead. Twenty feet away, a figure stood. She had short, blue-tinted hair, and her weapon of choice was a whip. A horn jutted out of her head on the right, and she wore azure clothing, accompanied by a luminant blue halo. The First of The Furies, Megaera. 

“Azrael. You don’t belong here on the surface. Angels like you should be in Heaven. You’ve already been tainted,” Megaera stated, already poised as if she was about to attack. 

“You don’t know who I am,” I grumbled. 

“You don’t know who you are,” Megaera cracked her whip and grinned. “I’ll introduce you to your brother soon enough.” 

“I don’t have a sibling. You’re lying,” I replied, filled with strange new confidence. Even if I had a sibling, I didn’t necessarily want to meet them. And besides, I’d have to explain to another person that I once knew that my memories were gone. 

“The Furies know of all dead and living. I know who you are, and who you were. You are but a lowly angel, but you were once so splendorous. What happened to you?” Megaera asked rhetorically. 

“I lost my memories, for some r—" I started, but the Fury interrupted. 

“Like that wasn’t obvious,” Megaera stated, narrowing her eyes. “Alecto and Tisiphone will be much less merciful with you. You have sinned deeply. Unless you repent, I will send you to the Jaws of Tartarus myself. The frozen sinners await your arrival, Azrael.” 

“I already am repenting. Sariel tasked me with slaying the Watchers,” I parried, crossing my arms over my chest. 

“Oh, did they? Well then, fine. I won’t stop you, but I’ll warn you. The Watchers do not hold back,” The Fury said. She adjusted her blue clothing and gripped her whip. 

“I know, they’re all hard to kill and whatnot. Spare me the details,” I snapped, cracking my knuckles. 

“May the Lord save you,” Megaera said sarcastically. “God forbid I tell you what you need to know.” 

I narrowed my eyes at her, vexed at her words. I hated when people used The Lord’s name in vain, especially when it came from a creature of light. “Do not use His name in vain, Megaera.” 

“He has not delivered a miracle for three centuries and counting. It doesn’t matter if I do so, since we know He left,” she countered, but her excuse was faulty. 

I adjusted my necklace. “He told us to never use His name in vain. I remember that clearly enough.” 

“Why does it matter? Do you even know how many Watchers there are?” Megaera asked, her usual snappiness still present. 

She was right; I had no clue how many there were. I also didn’t know who any of the Watchers were, other than the one in the city before us, and I didn’t even know its name or what it looked like. “Um... no, I don’t.” 

Megaera sighed, rubbing her temples. “Nobody told you. Of course. Well, I suppose I’ll tell you instead.” 

“In total, there are six of them. There used to be more, but they were slain over time. These six remain.” 

“And where are all of them? All the way across the world?” I asked, my voice tinged with annoyance.  

“They are all within the sea of the blind, the Aegean Sea. One is chained in this city, another lies at the outskirts, one lies in an endless maze, one lies in the straits of the blind sea, one is on a distant island, and the last roams free,” Megaera explained, still annoyed. “The Watcher of Envy resides within this city.” 

“I see. Well, um... thanks for the help, Megaera,” I said, embarrassed that I was thanking her. I wanted to sound strong-willed but thanking her made me feel weak. 

“Just go ahead and kill them all. Good luck,” The Fury turned around and flicked her wrist, and I watched the gates of the city begin to open. Her reptilian tail, which I hadn’t even noticed, flicked back and forth. The ashen grass swayed in the wind as the doors opened. 

The Tower loomed above the rest of the walled city, and people atop the wall peered at me and Megaera. 

The red-tinted clouds were pierced by the citadel. 

NEW BABEL /// FIRST 

BOUND BY INIQUITY 

“The Perforator of Heaven; stretching high past clouds red, 

Looming God-struck beacon of the misled, 

Split by a hundred dialects, split by astray reverence, 

 But united through the splayed gore in the heavens. 

The Eye of God gazes upon the restored peak, 

But He refuses to act, and many angels are weak, 

It feels like there is no hope; we have made our own purgatory, 

For The Son shall not arrive until the end of this allegory.  

There remains no light in the sky; so very dark, 

No holy angel preaching that we must hark, 

No longer do stars glimmer, scalding blood falls like rain, 

We listen to the downpour that falls on us, just the same. 

The warring nation of Crete is no longer a concern, 

For we cannot heal from our wounds, lacerations, and burns, 

Babel’s only foe is her own greed and hatred, 

This city is cracking; all we can do is shatter it. 

The bound fallen angel persists like a blight beneath us, 

Pugnacious light spilling through the cracks in surplus, 

The dying puppet decays, shackled in chains, 

As he chants a psalm of grief, malice, and pain. 

Witness the folly of humankind, 

Her lungs breathing in the name of the virulent mind, 

Her heart pulsing for the ruler masked in war and bloodshed, 

Our ruler leads us into the jaws of death; left unfed. 

And death will come, with a surge of pain, 

The tides will not cease; the tides will not abstain, 

And we gasp for air in an unrelenting sea of blood, 

And we will never surface; never escape the flood. 

War has struck us, Famine and Plague as well, 

The soul of Babel is held in hands that will toll the final bell, 

Our lives rest in the hands of the harbinger, 

We are locked in stalemate with ourselves, a city of murder. 

The masked ruler of this city schemes in shade, 

The toll for his unrelenting violence yet to be paid, 

The people of Babel persist in ignorant bliss, 

Then to the world, he blows a goodnight kiss.” 

Charon, Angel of the Afterlife 

From ‘Lamentations of This World’ 

I entered the gates of New Babel as they slowly opened. Metal creaked and vines were cut as red light flooded my vision. Here, I knew one of the Watchers inhabited; the Watcher of Envy. 
 

New Babel was huge, with simple residential buildings towering further than I could see. The streets had few people, and plants grew from the cracks in the cobble. Crimson lights dangled from above, only increasing the red hue of the city. I was unsure where to go, but I knew I had to be careful. Night was soon approaching, and it would be much harder to navigate. 

As I passed through the city, I got many malicious leers and looks from the residents, hiding in buildings. The sky above was hidden by catwalks and bridges, and the looming buildings seemed like they were watching me from above. With each step I took and with each structure I passed, I felt increasingly paranoid, and in a city like this, I knew that it was for good reason.  

Still ambivalent of where to go, I decided to enter a building. I approached the large, wooden door and knocked three times. While I waited for a response, I could hear someone inside mumble profanity. 

“Hello?” I asked, my hands shaking with nerves. 

I saw an eye stare at me through the peephole, and I swallowed. “Um... could you help me with something?” 

Almost immediately, the man replied very loudly, “Go away!” 

I sighed and turned away. I would need to ask someone else for information. 

I turned and looked back through the streets of New Babel. All the doors around appeared to be locked. 

I walked through alleyways and open doorways, stepping on cobble bricks and plates of metal. The harsh smell of rust permeated the humid air that was full of steam and fog, making it difficult to see and smell. I was forced to listen to the unnatural sounds of metal ringing against metal, the industrial noises of steam hissing, machines moving and twisting around like snakes, and other background clutter. But I also heard an oddly familiar sound, something I swore I used to hear in the heavens. Or... maybe somewhere else. 

I continued walking through alleyways and through the humid air, the sound getting louder as my steps started to echo. It was quiet now, only interrupted by my footsteps. I opened a large, metal, rickety door that opened into a sort of courtyard or street. 

 

Before me was a tall cathedral with red windows and a loud organ playing from within, intricately decorated with spikes, swords, and bloodstained glass mosaic windows, with designs of roses and violent scenes. It stretched high, piercing the bloody fog and emerging through a chasm in the city. The large doors were shut, hiding the interior from my weary eyes.  

I approached the church, my footsteps echoing throughout the dissonant chasm in the dense, violent city. High above, I could see the sky, splattered with drops of violence, glistening as I knocked on the massive doors of the cathedral. The sound ricocheted off the sharp points and bricks of the city. 

The pipe organ halted suddenly, the chord echoing through the vast cathedral. I put both my hands on the metal door handles, pulling the doors open with all my strength – which wasn’t much to begin with. 

 

Inside there were bricks the same color as outside, filled with red lanterns, candles, and mosaics, along with tubes that stretched the entire cathedral, the pipes to the organ. The sound continued to echo through the beautiful church, despite the music having stopped already. As I walked down a red carpet, I passed by many intricate-looking chairs, each dedicated to a different fallen soul that went to the church. Along with the chairs, giant pillars decorated with crosses and rubies stretched to the ceilings. On both sides of me, there were large, red glass mosaics with designs of kings and monarchs, but one caught my eye. 

A mosaic depicting a strange, ominous figure with intricate robes and a cracked mask with hollow eyes and no mouth. Behind him appeared to be a giant tower: the Tower of New Babel, certainly. There were bandages around his hands and the rest of his visible skin. 

I approached this mosaic, and below it was a label.  

 

Nimrod, The Head Chancellor of New Babel 

The Chancellor That Changed Our City Forever 

 

I had heard that name before. Nimrod handled the Tower of New Babel, at least, that was what I had heard. 

As I advanced through the large hallway, I passed by many other mosaics, all with labels underneath. Many were of kings and rulers of Babel, but some were of angels such as Raphael or Gabriel. One of them, named ‘Great Death’ was a figure covered in a hundred moths. Their eyes looked to be yellow, like an angel. But their wings were charcoal, like mine. No untainted angel had black wings; this had to be a fallen angel. This wasn’t the Watcher of Envy, but one of the other Watchers who I was unsure if they were dead or alive. Just what did the people of Babel worship? 

I was interrupted by a hand tapping my shoulder. 

 

“Ah, examining the mosaics, are you? The gifted glassmakers and artists of our church produced these. I assume you have not visited our cathedral before, and if so, well, you are welcome to enter our ceremony any time. We have recently decided to let all visitors in with pleasure,” A kind-looking man welcomed, smiling softly at me. I had flinched, nearly losing my balance. He apologized quietly and walked away. I nervously smiled back at the man, deciding to not say anything back. 

 

As I walked down the long hallway that was the aisle, passing by more mosaics and intricately decorated pillars, I halted at the sight of the pipe organ upon a balcony, above the cathedra and the altar. Below it was a statue of the same man. The statue was at least six feet tall, but it was elevated upon a pillar to make him seem taller than he truly was. 

The organ was large, decorated with engravings of flowers and with the skulls of a gazelle and a human, as well as many pipes that stretched the entire building and four rows of keys. To each side were fountains and containers of a dark red liquid that practically blended in with everything else around it. It, of course, was blood, which was fitting to be in a cathedral in a city like this. 

Somebody sat up there, and after a moment, they started to play a song. I was unsure what it was, but it sounded nice. I sat down on a chair and examined the church further. Along the walls were the stained-glass windows, depicting all the monarchs of the city, as well as a select few angels, but I now noticed that one window was shattered, and it seemed to be where Michael would have been. There were also balconies higher above, with chairs and even what looked to be a confession booth. Scarlet lanterns hung from the elaborate ceiling, dangling above the balconies, letting their violent light spill into the church. 

 

I was fascinated by the way the organ player’s hands flew across the keys, playing chords and melodies. They wore black robes and had many accessories. I sat down on one of the rows of chairs, wishing to listen to their beautiful performance, or rather, it seemed more like practice. Just as I sat down, their tempo seemed to slow down as they played one last, grand chord before standing up, listening as the chord echoed throughout the cathedral. It felt useless to sit now. 

The player turned around, not noticing me for a moment. But I recognized them. He was Sariel, the Angel of Execution; the angel I talked with not exceptionally long ago. He stretched his back a bit, yawning, and headed down the stairs onto the main level of the church, very content and happy with themselves. I sat up and approached him, briefly glancing around. 

Sariel then froze as soon as he saw me, a smile starting to grow on his face. I nervously smiled back since I didn’t really enjoy his presence. He was wearing the same clothes he had worn only hours prior, but his bandages had changed. 

“I knew you would be here, Azrael. So, Megaera spared you?” He asked, fixing his robes. He took off one of the pins and put it back on. I realized now that one of his pins represented the cycles of the moon. 

“Yes, she... she did,” I answered, brushing my black hair out of my face. 

“Interesting.” Sariel mumbled as he sat down on a chair. 

“I still need more information on what I need to do,” I said, still wary of this angel. 

“Well, you need to reach the center of the city, where the Second Watcher resides. He’s waiting for you, Azrael.” 

“It can’t be that easy. Surely there must be obstacles in my way, right?” I asked, narrowing my eyes. 

“There will be obstacles of varying degrees of difficulty. I would suggest taking a carriage to the center of the city,” 

“That... doesn’t answer my question. What kind of obstacles are there?” 

Sariel grumbled. “I was going to tell you later, but since you asked so nicely... you will face machines. Created by man, designed to kill the average enemy soldier. Now, since you’re an angel, there is more likelihood for you succeeding, but... there is one that will hinder your progress greatly.” 

“What do you mean?” I inquired. 

“It comes from a land far away. Its sharp blade can wound even the densest of metal,” he replied. “The Council already knows of your presence, and they are planning on using this machine against you.” 

“The Council?” 

“The group of nine chancellors who rule this city. Among these is Nimrod, the Head Chancellor. You’ll meet him soon enough.” 

“You mean that sculpture there is the Head Chancellor?” I asked as I pointed at the statue. 

“Yes. He guards the Tower of New Babel with his life, using machines and traps to thwart anyone who wishes to harm the Second Watcher.” 

I had more questions, but it felt dumb to ask some of them. “Um... is there a reason the city is so dark and gloomy?” 

“The rulers of the city only really prioritized the center of the city, where the aristocrats and the rich live. The other districts, such as this one, were mostly neglected. The red hue is not visible to normal humans.” 

“See you, Sariel. Thanks for the help!” I answered, turning and walking towards the door. I heard Sariel stroll back up to the organ, as I pushed open the door and went back into the city. 

 

So, the first thing I needed is a map. I had no idea where I was, and I needed to figure out where to go and the best route to get to it. 

Second, I would need a weapon. I wasn’t going to face that automaton Sariel mentioned, or the Second Watcher for that matter, with my bare hands. 

Third, I needed to survive. It was a dangerous city, that I knew. 

I entered back into the streets of the city, taking a deep breath. What was odd was there were barely any people, but instead, the occasional quadruped machine. Whether these machines were built for war or not, I knew I needed to be cautious around them. 

Walking across the broken cobble, I glanced around to see if I could find a building that would be of use. I passed by signs and passed by restaurants. Neither would work. 

After a few minutes of walking, I came across just what I needed. Well, other than a map. The sign at the top of the store read, ‘Karde’s Weapons.’ Perfect, I thought as I walked through the door. 

The woman inside turned towards me. Her skin was dark and almost shiny, and she was tall, taller than me. Her eyes were covered with a mask that was white and shiny, like quartz or porcelain. 

“Welcome! I take it you are here for a weapon?” She greeted me, her voice smooth and friendly. 

“Well, yes, I am. I come here to buy weapons, for a quest I was assigned,” I explained, approaching the front desk. Briefly, I glanced around at the store. It was made of caramel-color wood, almost shiny. Upon every wall was a fierce sword, battleaxe, spear, mace, whatever they all were called. 

“Well, you’re in the right place. Here, we sell all kinds of weapons, ranging from swords to polearms to axes!” 

“Interesting... I’d like a polearm, I think. Wait, how much does it cost?”  

“Thirteen hundred drachmas. I take it you don’t have such money, right?” The woman sighed, glanced around the room, and continued, “Look, I’ll give you the polearm if you can help me with something. There’s this… rogue machine roaming the streets. It shouldn’t be that difficult to kill, but it would help me a lot.” 

“Really? You’d just give a polearm away like that?” 

“W-well, I may have lied on the price. It’s closer to ten hundred drachmas. But still, I’m giving you a good offer. Why not take it?” she confessed, leaning back in a chair. 

“Okay, okay, fine. I’ll take the deal. Where is it?” 

 

The machine roared at me, baring its sharp teeth. It lacked eyes and instead had jaws open wide to consume its prey. It was like a horse in build, and it was intimidating. It was damaged, but its axe was huge, nearly the size of the machine itself. 

“ANGEL_SPOTTED... COMBAT_INITITATED... GOAL: TERMINATE.” 

The machine held its axe with an iron grip as it swung it towards me. With not much effort, I ducked under the attack and swung my dull blade at it, cracking its exterior slightly. 

This was the first machine I had seen that was truly meant for war, and I could tell. Its hooves were covered in dirt and rust, and gears jutted out of its back. It was scratched up and covered in dirt and grime. 

The sound of rusted gears grinding signified a new attack. The machine twitched as it swung towards me, but I was out of range. The attack didn’t hit, and from the weight of the axe, the tall automaton stumbled, having lost its balance. I took a moment to breathe. 

Climbing to its feet, it held its axe above its head. From somewhere within it, it sounded like something snapped, causing it to twitch before slamming the axe into the ground, cracking the cobble further. It had missed, and while it was struggling to get its axe unstuck, I leaped up its arm and climbed onto its back, staring at a panel for a few moments. My heart pounded and my thoughts raced, adrenaline racing through my veins. 

The panel was covered in little marks and gashes, it seemed many soldiers had already tried to stop this machine and failed. 

I pulled off the panel since it appeared to be loose already. Unsure of which wires would do anything, I reached my hand in and pulled out a handful of wires. I grabbed one of the gears poking out of its back and yanked one out. The automaton bellowed, knocking me off its back and onto the ground. I tossed the gear aside, landing on the ground hard. My shoulder ached with pain. 

It had regained its grip on its axe, and it held it over its head menacingly. The removed wires did nothing, and it was clear I would get injured. I braced for the pain, clenching my teeth and closing my eyes.  

But nothing happened. 

Opening my eyes, the machine’s head came loose, falling off its body and spilling red liquid everywhere. Its body split several times until it became a mess of guts, blood, and wires. The machine was filled with human flesh; I could tell by the smell. Had I just... killed someone? Or... did I simply kill something that just used human flesh as a fuel source? What had I just done? 

Before I could even think about what I had just done, the shopkeeper cheered and clapped for me. “Good job! Thank you for doing that, sir! Here’s your polearm, as promised!” 

The shopkeeper handed me the long weapon, smiling. Awkwardly, I replied, “Wow, um... thank you, miss.” She didn’t even realize that I was an angel, nor did she notice what the machine said about me. Humans couldn’t tell the difference between humans and angels, I realized. 

The shopkeeper just smiled wider and bid me farewell. They retreated into the shop, and I glanced around at the city once more.  

 

Now all I must do is find a map. I take it I’m still in the outskirts of Babel, so I know I have a long way to go, I thought as I passed through an alleyway leading back into the streets. 

I tried to get a feel for the polearm. It was heavier than I thought, but still swift and still dangerous. The polearm was long – like all polearms should be, but it was easy to move around with. I knew it was meant to be used like a stick – you’re supposed to attack only by stabbing. But the tip of the polearm – metal, dense, and rusted, was certainly strong enough to withstand a swing against metal. This would be my weapon until I found a better one. 

 

I bought a map from a kind man for around twenty-five drachmas. The map was high quality, but a bit outdated. 

I managed to find that courtyard I was previously in, then found where I was currently. I pulled out a feather pen I had also purchased, dipped it in some ink, and drew a line from the street to a large hole in the center of the city; what I assumed was going to become the Tower of New Babel, since the map was old. 

It was a few kilometers away, a distance I didn’t know if I could cross. But I had grown weary, and I knew I needed to rest, just I didn’t know anywhere that was safe. I would ask Sariel, but I wasn’t sure where he was. I doubted I would meet him until I reached the Tower of New Babel. 

I glanced up, staring at the Tower. I saw the giant cross atop the peak, golden and ornate. The cross was the symbol of the Messiah who had yet to arrive – the Son of God. I couldn’t remember who the prophet was, but it was prophesized that the Son of God would one day arrive, die for the sins of humanity, and lead us out of the darkness. 

But my thought was severed when I heard screams. 

NEW BABEL /// SECOND 

VICIOUS AUTOMATA 

“When the tension had met its apex that day, 

The darkest sky fell upon Gaia, dull and gray. 

The crows descended upon us, as a warning, 

The premonition was unheeded, met with scorning, 

But the corvids of night were right, 

The horrors of war had fallen in our sight. 

Babel had gifted machines with conscious existence, 

Metal beasts with blood in their systems. 

They could think, breathe, see, and bleed, 

Their hungry jaws – ours to feed. 

With their bloodied spears and rusted swords, 

They killed by their own accord. 

We have brought upon ourselves the burden of the dead, 

Every cemetery and every necropolis overfed, 

The dead are never honored, buried deep, 

From the depths, you can hear them weep, 

The gravediggers cannot do this forever, 

A funeral is now a pointless endeavor. 

The machines shattered and broke every nation, 

Every city fell, but one land laid its foundation, 

Crete stood tall with their crumbling bastions, 

Burning every flag, eyes burning with violent passion, 

They held their swords tight and bared their fangs, 

That day, the buried and the dead sang.” 

Charon, Angel of the Afterlife 

From ‘Lamentations of This World’ 

I gathered my thoughts as my eyes narrowed on a target. Only roughly thirty feet away was a war machine, taking the form of a centaur – a human-horse hybrid, with the four limbs of a horse and the two arms of a human. It held a bloodstained axe over its head, about to swing it. Below it was a boy who was only in his mid-teens. I widened my eyes in terror, grabbing a rock and throwing it towards the machine to distract it. 

Its head swung towards me, growling. Red lights lit up beneath its metal plating, and it completely ignored the boy. 

“ANGEL LOCATED... HUMAN: UNIMPORTANT. NEW GOAL: SLAY ANGEL.” 

That doesn’t sound good at all... I thought as I drew closer to the machine. Hundreds of other thoughts swirled in my head as my heart began to beat faster. The adrenaline pulsed through my veins, and I was starting to love the feeling. The closer I got, the louder its mechanized growls became. It had a gaping, strong jaw, open while it was screaming. Whatever the sound was, it sounded like it was some sort of war cry. The boy didn’t seem to notice that the machine referred to me as an angel, just like that shopkeeper. Humans didn’t seem to realize the difference between the heavenly and the earthly. 

It galloped closer to me, holding its axe by its side. It swung it upwards, scraping against the cobble and flinging rocks into the air. Its metal hooves collided with rough stones, creating harsh stomps that rang in the air. 

Fleeing, I readied my polearm as I searched for weak points. Most of its body was covered in metal plates, with cracks too small to be significant weak spots. Its axe was connected to its hand by nails, and the nails there were quite loose. Alongside that, stray wires, though thin and easy to cut, were strewn about the back of its head. The blade of its axe was dull, cracked, and old with use. 

Running up to the machine, I noticed that it would be hard to climb up even though it was modeled after a human-horse hybrid. Upon its neck was a plate that read 592-BLDSPLR. BLDSPLR seemed to be a shortening of ‘blood-spiller,’ which I assumed was the name given to this type of machine. It was effective and swift at its job, but I hadn’t seen anything yet. BLDSPLRs were much less powerful than other war machines that I would see after I left this city. 

 

592-BLDSPLR roared, producing several frequencies that split the air. A few frequencies were extremely low and a few were extremely high. Even though I could barely hear it, my head ached with pain. They struck my ears, and I winced, losing my balance in the process. The stones below me trembled and a couple of glass windows around broke. I fell to the ground, dropping my polearm as its metal hooves came closer to my frail body. I flailed in momentary agony as I watched it draw closer. 

But just as it was about to step on me, I regained control. I grabbed the polearm, rolling over and thrusting the weapon into a crack in between its main body and its front hoof. 

It slowed in its movement, slowing to a stop as I climbed to my feet. I pulled out the polearm, leaping up to climb onto its back. I scrambled to balance myself, crawling up its neck as it roared. 592-BLDSPLR moved its head erratically, trying to throw me off. I reached its head, holding onto one of its horns as I propelled the polearm into the missing plate where the stray cords came from. 592-BLDSPLR shrieked as I pushed the polearm deeper, and through the plating on the other side, the blade emerged. 

Just like the other war machine, the head split in half, rolling across the ground. Its jaw was still agape, its sharp teeth no longer able to bite. Then, the rest of its neck split down the middle, as I pulled out the polearm. I leaped off it, bruising myself on the impact. I watched as its body split in two, its legs falling off as the guts inside it spilled. A heart rolled out of all the viscera, perfectly still. It didn’t beat any longer; I was glad that it didn’t. 

Turning around, I saw the boy again. The boy ran up and hugged me. “Thank you so much! How can I repay you? You saved my life, after all!” 

My cheeks reddened from the sudden contact, and I awkwardly replied, “You need not repay me. I do not deserve such payment.” 

“Aw! Well, if you’re so sure. I’ll tell all my friends that you saved me, though!” he exclaimed as he walked away. 

“I... fine, I guess,” I mumbled, brushing myself off. 

 

The streets were still mildly empty, surrounded by those familiar tall buildings. Far away, I could see the Tower of New Babel, held by giant chains connected to each section of the city. From what I saw on the map, these sections were labeled Prefectures, and each one was named after a ruler of Babel or a culturally significant figure. 

I was at the edge of the Achilles Prefecture, or the outermost division. I would have to pass through the Goliath Prefecture, then into the Nimrod Prefecture – though on the map, it was only called the Central Prefecture. I recalled that the map was outdated, so it must have had to have changed in recent years. The Nimrod Prefecture was where I assumed I would have to kill the Watcher of Envy. Past that, there was the Sisyphus Prefecture, which was the other side of Babel entirely. There were three other prefectures as well, but the names on the map were too faded. 

Glancing back at the map, I saw a large strip. One singular building, a factory. A factory where war machines were built. It stretched from only a few blocks away all the way to the Nimrod Prefecture. It would be perilous, but it would save quite a lot of time. A small note on the map read, THIS FACTORY IS UNDER COUNCIL SUPERVISION. I assumed that meant the factory was expected to have cameras watched by the Council, or by those affiliated with them. The Council included Nimrod, and, from my limited knowledge, it was made up of six members, with those members being more like the Head Chancellor’s advisors. 

But that was a price I’d be willing to pay for such a useful shortcut. 

 

Walking down the street, I searched for the factory. The buildings seemed to blend, appearing to be one mess of structures. After what felt like forever, I saw a large building that appeared to extend for as long as I hoped. However, there appeared to be no door. 

I glanced around, spotting an alleyway that led behind it. I walked down it, briefly looking behind me. For as long as I had been in the city, I was constantly paranoid that something would jump out at me. 

At the other end of the alley, there was a small ‘clearing,’ like it was a forest, and there was a door on one of the buildings. A sign on the entrance read, “Combat Automaton Factory’ in bold letters. The door was rusted and heavy, and the metal was cold. I braced myself as I opened the door. 

 

The factory was vast, and the air was cold, and it became apparent just how long it stretched for. A catwalk above an incinerator was all that I stood upon, and glancing down at the factory, I couldn’t see an end. Thick wires were strewn about, machines heaving and gears grinding. Conveyor belts stretched from one end to the other, with bits of metal travelling across them. On ledges above the conveyors and gears, sniper-type machines sat prowling. 

From my knowledge, there were multiple classes of machines; melee, ranged or both. Then, there were variants of each class; for melee there were humanoids and centaurs, for ranged machines, there were snipers and throwers, and for both, I had yet to see. Not only that, but there were still non-living war machines that I had yet to see. 

I walked down the catwalk as the sounds of metal grinding together and steam hissing flooded my ears. Holding my polearm close to me, I slowed when I heeded a sound from one of the sniper-type machines. It didn’t seem to notice me, or if it did, it chose not to act. I glanced back at it, my hand on the cold railing. A light on its body repeatedly flickered, and I could hear its shot charge up. Then, it struck. 

“BLINK-BLINK!” 

I leaped out of the way, almost slipping on the metal grating. Steadying my breathing, I hid behind a pillar and glanced back. A hole was blasted through the railing; the shot having perforated the metal grating. The molten metal hissed, the heat pervading the air. Under the catwalk, I could see humanoid machines, slumping over, on the conveyor heading to the right. The machine that was targeting me was forty feet away, and it was small. 

I peeked at the ledge it was sitting on; it had lost sight of me entirely. I felt relieved and carefully walked closer to the wall on the other side. My heart was pounding as my feet collided with the metal mesh beneath me. I could see a lever on the wall, with a faded label. I stumbled on my own shoelace and fell onto the grating. 

“BLINK-BLINK!” 

Rolling out of the way, I grabbed hold of the railing as the shot blasted through the catwalk again. It was built to detect movement, and my stumbling was enough to alert it. 

I cautiously crawled over to the wall, hiding behind a pillar. I slowly and steadily stood up, examining the lever. The original label was faded, but small paper notes beside it read, ‘CAMERA SYSTEM ON/OFF’ in black bold text. I assumed that the cameras were on, the cameras that the machines saw through. Their vision was wirelessly connected to this lever. Hesitantly, I put my hands on the lever and pulled it down. 

 

I was both wrong and right. The machines underneath the grating shot their heads upwards, looking at me with their sharp teeth bared. Their gazes were dripping with malice; they clearly wanted to kill me. They were all humanoid, but smaller than that one I battled yesterday. I would then realize. I had made a horrible mistake. 

That was foolish of me... I’m dead, aren’t I? I thought, glancing up as I heard a whirring sound from above. The Council only now has their sights on me. 

A voice fell upon my ears, middle-aged and assertive. 

“You’ve just made a terrible, terrible decision, little angel. We – The Council – can see all you do now. We know what you’re trying to do, and we can’t allow it. You’d try to take down my beautiful tower, that much is clear. Whatever your motives are, they do not matter. You shall be punished for even trying to escape this factory. Chancellor Terali – activate the safety protocol, please.”  

Whoever this man was, he was important, for certain. He had to be one of the members of the Council, but I was unsure if he was one of the ones I had heard. 

The man paused, turning back to talk to this ‘Chancellor Terali.’ He then remarked, “you aren’t safe here, little rat. Now we can see every little move you take, every step that reverberates in this factory. I’ll make sure you take no more.” 

After a pause, someone behind him replied, “The task is done, Chancellor Nimrod. If there is nothing else, I shall check upon The Scourged One.”  

That meant that the man speaking was Chancellor Nimrod. Whoever The Scourged One is, I didn’t want to meet. But who else would it be if not the Watcher of Envy? 

“Satisfactory. Now, let me observe the demise of this foolish angel.” 

 

As soon as his words left his lips, deep alarms bellowed from deep in the factory, blaring in my ears. Why was a war machine factory being overseen by the Council anyways? It seemed like a normal facility, only that it produced war machines. I couldn’t think too much about it, though, for a lot of the machines were now hunting me. The man giggled as he watched me scramble around to search for an available path to take. 

I sprinted down the catwalk as I spotted a ledge I could leap to, while trying to be cautious of the holes. I climbed up the railing, steadying myself before jumping up to grab hold of the ledge.  

I caught myself, my heart racing as I climbed up to my feet. That sniper machine had lost sight of me already, and I was certainly lucky for that. However, the ground was certainly unsafe as well, for it was crawling with machines that would not hesitate to kill me. I steadied my breathing as I searched for an available path. 

“Sitting up there won’t do you any good. Once you reach the end, it’ll be infested with those things. Not to mention the special-grade machine down there as well. You’re not the only one who’s tried this, you know,” Nimrod said, sounding full of himself like I assumed he always was. 

“I assumed I wasn’t alone in this endeavor from the start,” I grumbled, staring up at the ceiling. Glancing down, I could see hundreds of blinking red lights, abominations of metal crawling all over each other like ants. 

I spotted a nearby catwalk several feet away from the ledge. I held on to wires as I cautiously stepped across the foothold, and then slid off, landing on the catwalk. There was a conveyor belt near this catwalk, which could certainly help – if the conveyor weren’t horribly slow or anything. 

Sprinting down the catwalk, I heard the machines grumbling beneath me. Glancing back, I leaped onto the conveyor, wincing momentarily as I rose to my feet. As the conveyor brought me across faster than I could walk, I saw the hand of a machine grip onto the transporter.  

Scrambling back, panic surged through my heart. My fight-or-flight kicked in, and I kicked the hand away with all my might. The mechanical beast fell, being crushed by a large grinder. Their blood sprayed up, landing at my feet. 

The conveyor belt took me across most of the factory, and it was moving too fast for any machines to keep up. I took a moment to breathe, knowing I was safe for at least a moment. Nimrod grumbled something beneath his breath, before yelling something to the chancellor behind him. 

Moments after he called out, the air grew hotter. Like everything else in this factory, the air felt like it was meant to kill me. The air was so thick, I could barely breathe. 

From above, a red glimmer of light shot across my peripheral vision, the crackle of electricity hanging in the warm air.  

“MACHINE ID: 761-AOTSS.SWR-TENSHI. ‘ANGEL OF THE SETTING SUN.’ TARGET: ANGEL, FRAIL AND WOUNDED. OBJECTIVE: KILL.” 

The voice was automated, and I could tell that whatever was speaking was not from New Babel, due to the way it pronounced certain words.  

I could hear Nimrod chuckling to himself as a tall, katana-wielding machine landed on the conveyor. It had a head like the shape of an arrowhead, with large wings that emitted red electricity. It also had a false halo above its head, suspended by some sort of magnet. Many red lights across its body flickered as it moved towards me, and with every movement of its katana, more scarlet voltage was emitted. In one hand, was its blade, and its other hand had sharp claws. Not only that, but the feet of the machine were also modelled after a bird and could grasp onto many kinds of surfaces. 

“There it is! This machine is not ours, you see. It wields the weapon used to kill the Watcher of War, far in the east! You see, this is one of the most powerful machines in our entire arsenal, and it was built to kill creatures like you,” Nimrod said. His prideful voice had started to become incredibly annoying. My breathing still hadn’t steadied from earlier.  

In the blink of an eye, 761-AOTSS.SWR-TENSHI, which I chose to abbreviate as simply 761-TENSHI, seemed to appear right in front of me, swinging its sword wildly. The red electricity forked like the patterns of veins, slicing right through a pillar that we passed. 

Why is it so fast? I thought to myself as I thrusted the polearm towards it. The swift machine dashed backwards, evading the strike.  

“UNSUCCESSFUL STRIKE. PREPARING ELECTRIC SWING,” 761-TENSHI declared, holding its katana behind it as forks of crimson light reached out like veins. The conveyor was going far too fast for me to leap off without getting harmed, so my only choice was to try to block the attack. This attack seemed more powerful than the others, as I could assume by it announcing the attack like it did. 

I ducked, covering myself in my own wings while I felt the stifling air split. The machine grumbled, stepping back when it realized it missed. I stood up and retracted my wings, then swung the polearm like a sword. The blade struck its katana, and the violent sound of grinding metal pierced my ears. I winced, then kicked the machine with my foot. 

761-TENSHI stumbled backwards, its bird-like feet doing nothing to help it. While it was staggered, I placed my foot on its chest and readied my polearm. It thrashed about, swinging its claws at me. 

Its claws scraped against my cheek, but I didn’t let that stop me. I thrust the polearm into its chest, retracting it after a moment. 

But when I let go of it and went to flee, I heard that same grinding noise, and before I could react, the machine swung its sword. 

 

Very luckily, it didn’t touch my skin. It cut off at least five centimeters of hair, so it was now only a bit past my collar but unevenly cut. From now on, I would think to put my hair up before fighting. In retaliation, I swung the polearm upwards, damaging its arrow-shaped head. It leaped above me, graceful like a butterfly, then landed behind me, swinging its katana through the conveyor belt, immediately stopping it. I was thrust backwards violently by the force, but I landed safely behind it. I swiftly turned around and thrust the spear at it, poking it just barely. 

It pushed my blade away with its katana, but I resisted, pushing against its force. Sparks flew off from the grinding steel, and after a long, agonizing screeching, it grabbed hold of my polearm, by the wooden handle. It took the spear out of my hands, and it tossed it away. I was now without a weapon, and nothing I possessed could substitute. 

My heart was pounding as I grabbed for something underneath the conveyor. A nearby pipe was loose, so I yanked it off. Climbing back to my feet, 761-TENSHI sprinted towards me, swinging its blade rapidly. Forks of lightning reached for the nearest metal, and as the sword met my makeshift weapon, a volt of electricity shot through my body. 

Stunned, I let go of the pipe, and 761-TENSHI growled. With its clawed hand, it pushed me over, knocking me onto the conveyor belt. The swiftly moving conveyor burned like fire against my skin, searing off some of it. It placed its metal bird-like feet on my chest, its claws digging into me. It held its electric blade to my chin, as terror raced through my body. The blood raced to my head, my heart pounding, and my breathing heavy and fast. As I gasped for air, I thought to myself, I’ve failed, and I hadn’t even slayed one of them... 

“Aw, look at you, all vulnerable. Say goodbye to your precious life!” Nimrod exclaimed excitedly. I could hear the smile on his smug face. 

 

But the machine didn’t do anything. The machine seemed deep in thought, its wings folding inwards. 

After a long hesitance, 761-AOTSS.SWR-TENSHI pulled away their katana and put it back into its sheath, letting me go. I tilted my head, confused. 

“BATTLE FOUGHT WELL... REWARD: 761-AOTSS.SWR-TENSHI, ‘ANGEL OF THE SETTING SUN,’ SPARES YOU.” 

“WHAT?! NO! THAT’S NOT HOW IT… THAT’S NOT HOW IT WORKS!” Nimrod screamed, seething. He slammed his fist on his desk, grumbling curses. I stood up and smiled at the intelligent war machine. 761-TENSHI bowed, handing me its sheathed blade. 

“TAKE IT. IT IS NEEDED FOR YOUR REPENTANCE.” 

“Thank you, 761-AOTSS.SWR-TENSHI. I... couldn’t thank you enough,” I replied, taking the blade and bowing as well. This machine was far more intelligent than any machine I had ever seen, and it would be among the most intelligent I would ever see. 

“FAREWELL, SKILLED ANGEL,” the machine answered, leaping away back into the depths of the factory. 

The conveyor belt slowed, and I was face-to-face with the wall between the factory and the innermost section of Babel. I leaped onto a catwalk, climbing over the railing. Landing on the grating, I turned, facing the door into The Nimrod Prefecture. Walking across the metal grates, my breathing eased, and my heart slowed. 761-TENSHI was right – I had fought well. 

I got a feel for the katana in my hand, still in its sheath. I didn’t have anywhere to put the sheathed sword on my person, so I would have to get a strap at some point. Then, I placed my hand on the door to The Nimrod Prefecture. 

“I swear I’ll kill you before you even make it to the tower,” Nimrod swore, his voice dripping with ire. I paid no attention to him, turning away. With newfound determination, I opened the door and emerged into the heart of the city. 

Here was where my journey truly began. 

NEW BABEL /// THIRD 

THIS CITY BLEEDS FOR YOU 

“Tyranny, a word disregarded and unnoticed by those under, 

A word only defined by the name of the so-called savior,  

The betrayer of his word and of his citizens, 

Demanding respect and allegiance despite his sins. 

A coward, a fake, a swindler, a fraud, 

Praising the absent, unseen God, 

A spineless tyrant with an insatiable lust for war, 

The blinded masses beg for more. 

The disease of this tyrant needs no alleviation, 

His wounds are bound to break him into oblivion, 

He is fated to be nailed down to the soil, 

A man that digs every grave of this city of turmoil. 

He provides the Watcher with life and with light, 

Ignorant to how he spreads the blight, 

He thinks he is doing good for the city, 

In his virulent mind, there is nothing to pity. 

And the angels pleaded, ‘Chancellor, This city bleeds for you, 

She taints the skies red and stains you with rue, 

You’re lacerated by war, just like we were, 

But Babel yearns for your death; will you bleed for her?” 

Charon, Angel of the Afterlife 

From ‘Lamentations of This World’ 

The streets were bustling, full of life. Ornately dressed aristocrats sneered at cloaked figures, sitting in carriages drawn by metal stallions. Only a few blocks away, the Tower of New Babel stretched up through the clouds, and the streets only went higher from here. Beneath that tower was the Prisoner of Eons, chained by holy shackles. I’ll get there soon... 

Walking down the street, people snickered at me, making fun of my outfit. I was still wearing only my bloodstained shirt, shorts, and boots. My hair was also shorter than it used to be, and I was unsure of how long it really was. They’re all looking at me... 

I was unsure of where to go, so I reached into my pocket to pull out the map. But I didn’t feel anything there. Either I lost it, or somebody stole it. I frantically glanced around; everyone was laughing at me. One aristocrat said, “A peasant! In our prefecture? How silly!” 

I sighed, pushing through the crowd of people. I was pushed over by some stranger, and I collapsed onto the sidewalk, watching as the crowd dispersed. 

I noticed everything that was wrong with me. Those cuts on my legs that weren’t there before. My hair was shorter, and uneven, thanks to 761-TENSHI. My pale face was freckled; a trait typically considered ugly. The bruises on my arms. The cut on my cheek. My weary eyes with my bright yellow irises. My slim, androgynous figure. My black wings like charcoal. 

And worst of all, I had committed an unspeakable sin. Someone had perished by my hand, for a foolish reason that I didn’t yet know. I didn’t deserve the honor of slaying the Watchers. 

I looked horrible; scarred and bruised. If I looked like this, I knew nobody would want to help me. Under the crushing gazes of the passersby, under the laughter that drowned me, tears formed in my eyes. 

I hugged my knees close to my body and covered my face with my hands, placing the sheathed katana beside me. I wept, my tears running down my face. I’m such an idiot... nobody will help me if I look like this... 

 

Then, I felt a warm hand on my shoulder. A soft voice, a voice I had heard before, called out to me. 

“Azrael. It’s going to be okay. You’re stronger than you think,” said the familiar figure. I quickly realized that this voice belonged to Arael, the angel who I had met at the shores of the Lethe. Their curly white hair fell in their face, and their azure-tipped feathered wings were tucked in close to their body. 

“L-leave me alone,” I protested, not even daring to look at them. I shivered, wiping tears from my eyes. 

“You will be okay. You can slay the Watchers; I know you can. So, pick yourself up and redeem yourself,” Arael replied, their voice oddly soothing as they pat my shoulder encouragingly. 

“Y-you’re lying! I’m not worthy!” I exclaimed, removing my hands from my face. I looked up at the angel, my vision blurred from the tears in my eyes.  

“No, you’re the one that is lying. You are worthy, you’re the only one who dared to even try this,” Arael parried, sitting beside me. “Pick yourself up. You can do this.” 

I wiped the tears away, staring at Arael meekly. “L-look at me... I’m terribly wounded.” 

“That doesn’t matter,” they answered. They reached their hand out to tap the cut on my cheek. In only moments, the wound closed, and the ichor evaporated. I gasped quietly, watching as they mended my other wounds. “You are well now.” 

They placed their hand upon my legs, the cuts all mending. They smiled at me, standing up and reaching out their hand, “Stand up, Azrael.” 

I took their hand, pulling myself up. I thanked them quietly, and I was filled with newfound courage.  

“Now, go to the base of the tower. Sariel should help you from there,” Arael said, pointing at the Tower of New Babel. Now that I was so close to the spire, I saw a bedazzled cross atop the peak, piercing the clouds like a spear. 

“T-thank you, Arael. Um... take care,” I mumbled, smiling at them as I wiped the final tears from my eyes. I picked up the sheathed katana, turning away from Arael and reluctantly walking away. 

When I glanced back, the angel was gone, the only trace being one of their azure-tipped feathers. I sighed, turning back towards the tower. I gripped my katana more firmly, and I advanced into the city. 

 

The mostly quiet streets started to get more crowded the further I got. From afar, I could hear a loud, distinct voice, but he was too far away for me to understand what he was saying. Everyone I passed by cheered whenever he said something they considered agreeable. 

I then was lost among the sea of people, holding the katana tight and close to me. I tucked my wings in, and I could hear the man speak now. Lanterns ascended from the crowd, and the cheers of the masses grew louder. 

I glanced up at a tall altar jutting out of the ocean of people. A robed individual with a weathered, silver mask upon his face stood there, preaching to the masses. He wore crimson robes, and he had a golden crown of leaves atop his head, a common tradition for rulers of the area. Bandages were wrapped around his hands and his neck; he was scourged by some disease. He looked exactly like the figure that was depicted in the mosaic in the church.  

“It’s a glorious day, is it not? The Tower stretches above us all, its peak piercing the clouds. It is imperative that it stays standing, so I must tell you all something,” the man said. I recognized the voice – it was the man that was speaking to me in the factory, undoubtedly. Nimrod, as he called himself. 

“You see, since Crete formed a truce with us, we have aimed to aid both nations as to prevent more conflicts. But yesterday, some of our own soldiers went against orders and stole one of Crete’s most powerful weapons. Right beneath our own noses, our soldiers broke the truce,” Nimrod remarked, his voice assertive and clear through his mask. “You all know what this means, right?” 

The crowd gasped collectively. Nimrod chuckled, “We’ll never convince Crete to cease. We never meant to start this war, but we might as well win! WE SHALL BE VICTORIOUS ONCE AGAIN!!!” 

When his words fell on their ears, the crowd roared with cheers and laughter, people jumping around and celebrating. It became clear that the people of New Babel enjoyed war, for unknown reasons. I was shoved about, crushed by the crowd, and I could barely move anymore.  

I asked the man beside me to move, as kindly as possible. But the man didn’t move, he didn’t seem to hear me. I sighed, holding my katana close and trying to breathe. After a moment, the man moved and gave me room to breathe, and I sighed in relief. 

I caught my breath as I looked up at Nimrod, standing atop the altar. His arms were wide as he chuckled. His laughter died down as he began to speak again.  

“However, there is an issue. We have foolishly used most of our war machines against foes belonging to smaller, more insignificant nations that attempted to take us down. These nations have dismantled several of our best war machines or rendered them powerless, despite them being so weak. We are without our greatest weapons, and this is a great issue. Diplomacy is simply not an option with a nation like Crete. In other words, we must have a different solution,” he paused, adjusting himself briefly. 

“We need more soldiers to fight in this war. We only have a handful of war machines at our disposal, one of which is currently stationed outside the city at the Beaches of the Aegean Sea. This is not enough for a single battle, let alone a war. If everyone standing here today were to apply, we would crush Crete and their crumbling bastions,” Nimrod stated, his motions unnaturally calm and stress-free. 

“Crete has already sent their forces to us. It is expected that their soldiers will arrive in three days. Tomorrow at dawn, the gates of the city will close, and the reinforcements will go up. If you must leave, it is best to do so now. If you try to re-enter, you will be struck down by our military. That is all, dear denizens. Good day,” Nimrod said, adjusting his mask before striking some odd pose. His right hand was level with his face, with his ring finger and his pinky finger curled inwards. His thumb was pointing inward, and his other arm was tucked behind his back. This was the pose that I saw him doing in the mosaic in the church. 

It seemed that Nimrod was saying that the walls of the city were going to close as soon as night fell. This meant that after I had slain the Watcher of Envy, I wouldn’t be able to leave the city if I took too long. 

As the crowd slowly dispersed, I glanced around to search for where I needed to go. 

 
	After the crowd had left mostly, I realized that I was in the central city square. The ground was polished, unlike the cobble of the rest of the city, and people strolled around. Giant buildings stretched all around me, only being rivaled by the Tower of New Babel, to which I was now remarkably close. 

The clouds above were scarlet, like they were in the rest of the city, and the dark sky above had no stars. The gaslit lamps around the square were the reason the stars were veiled. Also, the Council Building, which was right at the base of the tower, was busy. I could distantly hear people arguing and conversing within the building. 

I walked towards the entrance into the Tower of New Babel, where the Council was discussing. 

I emerged into the building, locking the door swiftly. I heard voices arguing a few rooms away, and I could hear a specific voice that I recognized: Nimrod’s voice. 

The building had a strange layout. It had a central hallway, with several doors going into other rooms. Above me were chandeliers, illuminating the corridor with gold light. I tiptoed past a few empty rooms, until I reached the room where I assumed The Council was currently. 

I was going to sneakily stare into the room, but I was interrupted by someone walking through the door, catching me in the act. Of course, it was Nimrod again. 

I gulped, unsettled by Nimrod’s mysterious nature and his weathered mask. His brown hair matched the rest of his outfit quite nicely, the brown and red contrasting to highlight the silver of his mask. His bandages were pristine white, and I realized what his disease was. 

Nimrod had leprosy, and he covered his whole body so nobody else could get it. Despite his blight, he was so confident. It was almost inspiring, but truth be told, I would never be inspired by his violent tendencies. 

“Ah, there you are. I knew you would be here,” Nimrod said, chuckling beneath his mask. 

“What do you want with me?” I asked, stepping away from the man. The Head Chancellor, despite being so threatening, was shorter than me by a respectable margin. I had an advantage against him. 

“You heard me in the factory, little rat. Whether it be my hand or not, you will perish before you enter the tower.” 

“And... how do you plan to do that? An old, plagued man like you couldn’t—” 

 

Nimrod grabbed something attached to his belt, throwing it at me. Whatever it was, I jumped to the other side of the corridor. My heart rate spiked, and I gripped my katana tighter. “I knew you would do that.” 

Nimrod chuckled, adjusting the bandages on his hands after they fell apart. For a split second, I could see the warts on his frail hands. I gasped quietly as he replied, “Though I may be scourged with leprosy, I can rule this city fine. I know what you are, angel.” 

There it was again. He referred to me as an angel, but humans weren’t supposed to be able to tell the difference between humans and angels on earth. I stood tall, trying to be confident. “How do you know I’m of holy blood?!” 

“You have that golden glint in your eyes. Your charcoal wings are outstretched. I was blessed with the ability to see through the veil. You do not fool me, little rat,” Nimrod grumbled, stepping closer to me steadily. His breathing was uneven and raspy, likely because it was so difficult to breathe through his mask. 

“A human like you shouldn’t be able to see through it. How... how did you get such sight?” I asked, gripping the katana tighter, my knuckles turning white. 

Nimrod turned away from me and tucked a strand of hair behind his ear. He answered, “The fallen angel gave me a disease. I thought it was hopeless for me. Leprosy is a disease with no cure, as you know. My skin rotted away with warts and with sores. But there was an upside to it as well. Handling the fallen angel so often gave me a blessing, too. When I started to cover myself in bandages as to not spread the disease, I noticed something. I could tell the difference between those of heaven and those of earth. I was given eyes of the divine by the fallen angel, and the day that he told me to build the tower, my life was turned around. Just look at me now; I’m the Head Chancellor of one of the greatest nations in centuries.” 

“So you must know what I’m here for. That’s why you’re trying to kill me, right?” I inquired, staring at the plagued chancellor. 

“That’s right. I know that you are to slay the fallen angel shackled beneath us. I know your goal is to split the nation once more. I know your goals, angel, and I can’t allow it,” Nimrod said, his robes swaying as he paced from left to right. He halted, turning towards me. “I see through your lies.” 

I gulped nervously, knowing that what he said was exactly what I was to do. “And how will you stop me?” I asked, crossing my arms. 

The chancellor snickered, holding a cross in his bandaged hands. “There are many, many ways I could kill you. But even if you survive those, you will certainly die by the hands of the fallen angel. His blades are as sharp as they are deadly.” 

“And what will you do if I live? What will you do if I slay the fallen angel?” I asked, narrowing my eyes at the man. 

Nimrod chuckled. “Foolish angel. That isn’t going to happen. The jaws of my machines will shred you to worthless viscera.” 

“I managed to stay alive against 761-AOTSS.SWR-TENSHI. You said that machine was one of the most powerful that New Babel possessed.” 

The chancellor grumbled something from behind his mask. “It is. You only survived because it spared you.” 

I was still confused as to why the Angel of the Setting Sun spared me. It could have killed me at once, but it didn’t do anything. 

“Then how else will you kill me?” I asked, vexed. 

“Me and the Council will decide. Come, let us discuss your fate,” Nimrod said as he opened the door into the room with the rest of the Council. 

I followed him into the room, reluctantly. 

 

The floor was wooden, and a red carpet stretched from here to a table, where there were nine people sitting: four on one side, four on the other, and one at the end. At the end of the table was an empty chair, where Nimrod walked over to. The others immediately turned their gazes to me, but I knew they didn’t have the same sight as Nimrod. 

Whispers slithered from ear to ear of each Chancellor, except Nimrod, who stayed silent. The silence was interrupted by a man with a silver prosthetic arm, who slammed his metal fist on the table. 

“You will not enter the cavern. Not unless Head Chancellor Nimrod lets you in,” The man said, his voice rough from age. I took several more steps, sitting down at the other end of the table. 

“I’ll find my way in there,” I promised, crossing my arms. “I have my ways,” 

“Little rat. Even if I let you in, you would never emerge alive. The Scourged One has not been fed in months. He thirsts for your flesh,” the masked Chancellor spoke. 

“The Scourged One is weak. He is old and he is frail,” I said and grinned. 

“And how do you know that? You have never met him,” another Chancellor parried. 

“He must be lying! A bluff,” the man with the prosthetic arm exclaimed. 

“My friend told me,” I responded. I was, of course, talking about Sariel, who informed me about the Watcher of Envy. Sariel had never actually told me whether the Watcher of Envy was weak or not, he had only told me some details about the chained Watcher; so I had lied, just for a small gain. 

“Send the angel down!” one said. “The Scourged One shall slay them with ease!” another exclaimed. The Councils erupted into chaos, yelling and slamming their fists. 

“ORDER! THERE WILL BE ORDER!” Nimrod yelled, breaking the chaos. He sighed, nodding. “I shall send the angel down, only if they have a death wish.” 

I gulped, still nervous about meeting the Watcher of Envy. “That’s right! Send me down already,” I said, faking confidence. “What else would lurk in the cavern? Those machines you speak of, perhaps? I still haven’t seen a single machine try to kill me since you swore to kill me. You lie, Chancellor Nimrod.” 

Nimrod grumbled, recognizing his folly. He slammed his fist on the table loudly in vexation. “Chancellor Terali, send the angel to SHR-355. Only if they manage to survive do they deserve the honor of even laying their eyes upon the Scourged One. And even so, the elevator is faulty. They might plummet to their death,” 

The man with the silver prosthetic arm nodded, standing up violently and walking over to me. He grabbed me by the collar and dragged me out of the room, ignoring my complaints. 

“Sir, s-stop holding me like that! I’ll choke,” I coughed, but he didn’t listen. He took me to a room at the end of the hallway, tossing me onto the ground. Chancellor Terali sighed. 

“Nimrod’s orders. I can’t disobey him or else he will execute me. Sorry,” he apologized, before pressing a button on the walls of the dark room. 

 

Gears grinded and machinery twisted, with red lights turning on overhead. “Good luck,” Chancellor Terali said before slamming the wooden door on me, locking it. 

The red light barely illuminated the room, and I could hear something in the shadows. I could hear a chainsaw grinding against metal. Then I saw its teeth. 

 

SHR-355; also known as ‘Security Hellhound Razor version 35.5’, as I observed from a panel on its chest, was modeled after a canine and a mincer like the ones in the factory. Its teeth rotated inwards like gears, its sole purpose was to kill and shred. Firm wire hung from its rear, connecting to a chainsaw; this wire was its tail. It was tall, larger than a normal canine. Each of its claws were serrated and sharp, covered in little hooks. It had no eyes and was covered in dried human blood. 

It sneered at me, its tail flicking back and forth. I brandished the katana and readied myself to fight against SHR-355. I held my charcoal wings close. 

It acted first, leaping towards me with its jaws agape. Quickly, I rolled out of the way, nearly tripping in the process. I noticed that the light above was coming from a skylight, and I could tell dusk was upon me. 

I retaliated back by kicking it onto its side, stunning it briefly. As it struggled to get back to its feet, its chainsaw tail drew closer to me. Before it could cut me in half, I held the katana out and blocked the strike, with sparks flying as the chainsaw slowed down. SHR-355’s chainsaw completely stopped spinning, and it became clear that the katana could not be stopped by the saw. 

The machine growled viciously and retracted its tail, the industrial humming continuing. Its jaws opened wider as it leaped towards me. Its sharp claws were able to pin me down onto the floor, and its rotating teeth grew closer. 

I grabbed ahold of it and threw it at the door, with surprising ease. It was far lighter than I thought. The war machine crushed the wood and broke through the door, emerging on the other side. Quickly, I followed it through the hole in the door and emerged back into the hallway. 

Chancellor Terali, who had been listening to the fight from the outside, yelped. He scrambled to figure out a solution. He didn’t want to be ripped to shreds by the mechanical beast, and nor did I. 

The argent-armed chancellor charged towards the canine executioner, pushing it onto its back. He quickly ripped off the panel on its chest and tried to find the switch to turn it off, but he was knocked away. 

I watched in horror as SHR-355 leaped onto the staggered Chancellor Terali. He yelped as his robe was caught in the jaws of the machine, and he was dragged into the grinders, being completely shredded apart. His screams echoed, and I could hardly bear to watch. But then when SHR-355 reached his prosthetic arm, the shredders stopped entirely. 

His golden arm was able to stop the mechanical beast that the Council stored away. The lights on its back flickered and the humming of its chainsaw stopped. The metal was able to completely break SHR-355. 

 

A door a few rooms away suddenly swung open and out came that bothersome Head Chancellor. His mask was slightly askew, and he looked disheveled. 

“For the love of all that is good...” Nimrod breathed out, quickly scrambling towards the mess of shredded flesh and broken bones that was Chancellor Terali. 

Nimrod tried desperately to pull out his argent arm, but it was no use. It was stuck in the shredders. Then he looked at me, and I swallowed hard. 

“Little rat... you managed to break through the door, and you simply watched as Chancellor Terali was completely shredded to bits,” Nimrod remarked. He stood up and grabbed a dagger from his belt and put it to my throat. 

“The least you could’ve done was to sacrifice yourself. I’ll have you know that the life of Terali was worth far more than yours will ever be. I will feed you to the Scourged One. I’ll never let you live, even if I must kill you myself.” 

“The war will tear you apart. If the Watcher of Envy dies, Crete will become unstoppable – unless I kill the Watcher there. If you kill me now, the war will break this nation. If I survive, New Babel and Crete may be able to coexist, in true peace and harmony,” 

“Maybe so, but I doubt you’ll be able to survive the twin blades and sharp claws of The Scourged One. If he survives, we will crush Crete, for certain,” Nimrod said. 

“How do you know he thirsts for the flesh of angels? How do you know I won’t kill him as soon as I make it into the cavern?” I asked, trying to stay as calm as possible. 

Nimrod grumbled something under his breath. “Go. Kill the Scourged One or die trying,” he put away his dagger and tossed a key at me. “That’s the key to the door into his chamber. Lose it and your life is the next thing that’s being lost,” Nimrod threatened, but I knew a frail man like him wouldn’t be able to kill me himself. 

“Fine. Go ahead,” I said, reaching down to grab the key. I headed for the elevator, leaving the old chancellor behind. He sent another chancellor with me, and right as he led me to the elevator, he said the words that would resonate in my skull for an eternity. 

 

“No matter where you are from now on, your end is nigh, little rat.” 

NEW BABEL /// APEX 

SONGBIRD OF MALIGN 

“Deep in the dense city of brutality, 

Flesh is stolen and grafted onto something rotting, 

Something that prolongs its own mortality, 

With a rusty, bloody pair of blades appalling. 

Within the forsaken hell, it prowls, spreading its blight, 

With an unholy heart that is not its own, 

Something once holy, tainted by a profane light, 

With an eye unblinking, open it is sewn. 

Envious is the puppet that takes, 

Forcing blood to splay at its command, 

And against the decaying metal, its blade scrapes, 

Hiding under the tower that stretches above all land. 

Below Babel, the ancient fallen angel is breathing, 

With despair, malign and grief it sighs, 

A psalm regarding its demise it is singing, 

But the psalm means nothing at all, for from age, it will never die. 

‘I yearn for escape, clawing at thy walls, 

Though one day, I shall meet long-awaited death, 

I am chained beneath thee, chanting unheard calls, 

And within thy boundless stomach, I shall have my final breath.” 

 Charon, Angel of the Afterlife 

From ‘Lamentations of This World’ 

A chancellor came with me, holding the key that Nimrod had given me. He walked up to a sliding metal grate, pressing a button beside it and waiting for a moment. I took the moment to lean down and tie my shoelaces, although it took me a bit longer than normal. I still didn’t remember much, including how to tie my own shoes. It was humiliating, but I had to learn again.  

After a moment, the door slid open, and the chancellor walked in. I stood up and walked in after him, glancing around. I had never been in an elevator, and it felt scary. I mean, I was in a metal box suspended so many feet from the bottom of the shaft. I gulped nervously as I watched the intricately clothed chancellor reach out and press a button.  

He pressed the bottom button, which had a label beside it that read Level -12. Above that button were seventy other buttons, each for a level of the Tower. The ground level was already so tall, and the Tower loomed over all creation, so seventy floors all similar heights made sense. 

We both stood in the elevator, staring at each other. I leaned against the metal wall, holding onto the railing. I held the katana in my other hand. The man appeared nervous, but I knew I didn’t look that intimidating, with my awfully revealing shorts. He kept glancing at my katana, terror visible in his eyes. 

“How long will this take?” I grumbled, letting go of the cold steel and crossing my arms over my chest, laying the katana against the railing. 

“It won’t be much longer, miss... I mean, sir!” The chancellor exclaimed, a bead of sweat falling down his forehead. 

I sighed, facepalming. “Just be quiet,” I grumbled and wiped the sweat off my forehead. The chancellor nodded quickly, his hands shaking. 

The katana fell over, hitting the floor with a thud. He stared at me with fear as I picked it back up and leaned against the wall again. I gestured vaguely as if to ask, “Why are you scared of me?” 

“Please don’t kill me... I don’t want to die,” the chancellor whimpered, shrinking under my gaze. 

“I won’t kill you unless you get in my way, sir,” I answered, glancing at something else so the man wouldn’t be so fearful. 

After a moment, a light turned on in the elevator, and a sound played. “Level Negative Twelve,” it announced. 

The elevator door opened, revealing a large room with a giant, rusted door. The chancellor walked up to it, inserting the key and turning the doorknob. I heard a click from within the door, and the metal groaned. He left, and I walked up to the door. 

I tightened my grip on the sword, slowly pushing open the door. The metal groaned again, the door scraping against the earth, and I was finally at the end of my journey in this violent city; or so I thought. 

 

The room was vast and echoey, the air thick with tension. The floor was of cracked stone, clearly laid down years ago but still mostly intact. The walls and ceiling were of natural rocks and outcroppings, with vines and moss snaking across them. It was dark, with the only light being a couple of candles. Chains hung from the stalactites, rusted but covered in golden carvings. Skeletons were strewn across the room, varied in age and in state.  

The air was foul with the scent of rotting flesh; it was almost hard to breathe. I could barely bare to stay down here with an odor like that. 

It was silent in the vast room, apart from my footsteps. I could feel the presence of something else, but it was far too dark for me to see what it was.  

I was too petrified of whatever was lurking here that I stumbled into an old, rotting skeleton. I fell over, crushing its brittle bones and knocking over a candle. I yelped like a young girl, immediately regretting it. I pushed away the skeleton and climbed to my feet. 

 

Whatever was down here had known I was here. The sound of the rattle of chains and the scraping of metal echoed throughout the vast cave. I could hear the sinew snap and the bones crunch as its spine twisted to meet my gaze. Then, the raspy sigh of the creature left its mouth, and I was paralyzed with fear. 

A yellow eye opened from deep in the shadows. Its eye was a luminant golden, exactly like mine. It was of holy blood, at least it was at some point in the past. It laughed weakly, but I wasn’t sure why. 

“Finally, the end of my misery and sorrows... has descended upon me. The eyes of death hath narrowed on me... thy gaze is piercing,” an old and raspy voice spoke.  

Several more flames suddenly lit around the cavern, illuminating the cave and whatever was speaking fully. He brandished his twin blades, standing up at the other side of the grotto. 

He was tall, at least three feet taller than me even when he was hunched over, and he was horrifying to look at. He held a pair of blades that were stuck into a shackle and held in his hand, a pair of makeshift scissors that could be used as a weapon. His eye was sewn open, and his body was held together by string and patches. He had a vaguely human silhouette apart from sharpened bone sticking out of his body, primarily his head. A beating heart partially obscured by a damaged ribcage pulsed within the cavity, a heart that appeared to belong to a human. Some teeth laid within small cavities, and he only had one golden yellow eye at his head. From a hole in his head, teeth or sharpened bone sprouted like weeds, sharp and covered in human blood. Tangled around his body were rusted chains covered in glowing golden carvings, restricting his movement greatly. The Watcher of Envy’s wings were spread, pieces of skin sewn together. 

“Youthful angel... thy presence serves one purpose, this... this I know is correct. To put me to rest, after eons of my suffering,” He remarked, coughing repeatedly. He started to wheeze, until something fell out of his abdomen, a bone. It was one of his ribs. He brandished his blades, his wings twitching. “It has finally come to this... I, a cruel and jealous heretic... versus thee, a wounded, youthful angel.” 

I paused, staring at him with uncertainty. I was unsure if I should feel sad, angry, or determined. What I did know is that I would have to kill the being before me. And this time, I could not hold back. If I held back, then I would be killed. But if I didn’t hold back, then his blood would be on my hands. 

“I’m sorry. This is what I must do,” I said, brushing my hair out of my face and pausing for a moment. “I don’t know what you did, but... I’m sorry you had to be chained up like this. And I’m sorry that I must kill you. This is just... how it goes.” 

“Thou needn’t apologize. I drifted away from the light... and I was shackled here... for a century. For some, it was justified. So it goes... the tale of I, Marekophix; the Watcher of Envy.”  

Marekophix tried to walk closer to me, but he was stopped by his chains, which made him flinch and stumble over. He fell to his knees and stared at the cracked ground. 

“It is thy decision, angel... if I am not slain, the earth shall remain in its binding state of iniquity... but if thy blade impales my heart, thy heart shall be consumed with rue, and I feel thou shall descend with it.” 

“You’re right. I have killed machines, I have killed insects, but... you’re different. You’re one of my own kind. I don’t know if... I should do this,” I replied, my heart pounding in my chest. Just what was this creature in front of me? How would I kill it? 

“This is what it has come to... thy choice dictates the fate of the world. Only one... shall emerge from this cavern into earth above. Only one of us shall lay our eyes on the eternal sun once more, casting its radiance upon us all. One shall persist. One shall breathe nevermore.” 

“Even if I perish, you will never escape this cavern. You’re far too weak to even ascend the elevator,” I stated, drawing my blade. 

“The rotting puppet before thee... has accepted its end. For every futile suicide, I grew nearer to a state of indifference towards my end. For every self-inflicted wound, I ascended that precipice of uncaring. It won’t matter if I persist, for I will perish soon enough nevertheless.” 

“Good, then. You’re ready, I see,” I said, steeling myself. 

Marekophix snapped his chains with his scissors, chuckling. “Free... at last,” he said and spread his wings. He climbed to his feet, towering above me. “It has been far too long... since these chains... have ceased to shackle me.” 

I outstretched my katana, its tip meeting the Envious Puppet’s broken shackles. I stabbed the keyhole, breaking the shackle in half, to make it a fair fight. When I put the sword to his other shackle, he pushed it away. He needed the shackle to hold his scissors in place. 

He stood up tall, raising his scissors up to point towards me. “I, Marekophix, the Watcher of Envy, challenge thee to a duel. I assure thee that it will be fair,” 

“I accept. Don’t hold back, Marekophix,” I said and stepped backwards. 

“Watchers like us know not to restrain ourselves.” 

 

Marekophix dashed towards me, his blades closed. He swung his scissors, missing me but getting stuck in the cracks of the floor. The tall angel grumbled, struggling to pull them out. 

In his struggle, I swung my katana at Marekophix, the red voltage forking like lightning. He somehow managed to parry the strike with his closed blades. Sparks flew as our blades clashed together, and the Puppet that Takes seemed to smile, despite having no lips to do so. 

My heart hammered against my ribs, and I thrust the blade forward. The katana pierced his throat, snapping some of the strings that connected his body and his head. He retaliated by opening his scissors and pressing both sides of them at each side of my neck. 

I gasped, my heart racing even faster. Marekophix tightened his blades, and ichor trickled from each wound. I could feel the arteries pulse with terror as the jaws of death closed in on me. I could read small engravings on each blade. The blade he held was ‘Bloodlust,’ and the blade attached to his wrist read ‘Brutality.’ My mind raced; I could not devise a solution.  

Marekophix grumbled, loosening the scissors. “I wish not to slay thee... straightaway. This clash would be for nought if I felled thee so soon,” Marekophix said, his raspy voice originating from somewhere within his body. I felt relieved, wiping a bead of sweat off my forehead. Marekophix pulled away, wrenching Brutality from his wrist and tossing it aside. “I promise thee... a just clash!” 

He swung his blade at me, and like he blocked mine; I blocked his strike. More sparks flew as I examined his body for weak spots. His heart was mostly exposed, but a fragment of a ribcage covered it, so it would be hard to hit it through that. However, I could hit his stomach, which would at least cause him pain.  

He accidentally let his sword get pushed aside, and I pushed the katana into his abdomen, piercing his body entirely. 

The Songbird of Malign coughed, staring at the floor as he gasped for air. From the cavity in his chest, a surge of ichor poured out, splattering on the floor. “C-Cunning angel,” he groaned as I pulled out the blade. He coughed once more, spinning Bloodlust in his hands. 

He swung it at my head, and I ducked out of range. When he swung again, I tossed my sword ahead of me. As I felt the sword nearly graze me, I tucked my limbs in and rolled out of the way, grabbing the katana and leaping upwards. 

I gripped the blade backwards, stabbing it into Marekophix’s shoulder, where several cysts were. One of the cysts popped, and I grimaced as an odd substance exploded, some of it landing on me. When Marekophix swung at me again, I had to leave my blade stuck in Marekophix’s body, and I had to duck out of the way. I grabbed a broken string of chains and swung them at Marekophix. 

The chains wrapped around his leg, and I pulled the links closer to me, knocking the Watcher off his feet. I stood up and leaped backwards, evading his body as it came crashing onto the cracked stone. 

He grunted and struggled but there was enough time for me to grab 761-TENSHI’s katana once again and kick him with my boot. Marekophix snickered again, despite being in pain. “Thy mind is so agile... I cannot keep pace with thee,” he said, laying on the ground. 

Marekophix climbed to his feet, panting. “Would thou be so kind to let me...” he coughed again, more ichor spilling out, “to let me have a moment to rest my lungs?” 

I paused, stepping away. “I... sure, that’s fine. It’s supposed to be a fair fight, after all,” I answered. I let him pause to respirate, but I suspected that he might be lying. I took the opportunity to catch my own breath as well, to ease myself, but I stayed vigilant. “How are you even alive after a century of being down here?” 

Marekophix sighed, staring at me with his luminant eye. “My heart does not beat like thine does. I live, but my soul perished an eternity ago. My body, my vessel, only remains thanks to the rulers of this city; this city of pugnacity thine eyes have witnessed.” 

“Really? What did they do for you?” I asked, feeling some empathy for the Watcher of Envy. 

“Chancellor Nimrod... I am aware that he despises thee. However, he gave me a light of which I had never felt on my skin, neither sunlight nor moonlight. Nimrod provided me with... sustenance, with life.” 

“Nimrod? But... he tried to kill me! Why would he ever help an angel?” I inquired, raising an eyebrow. 

“It is because... thou art holy... and I drifted away from the light,” Marekophix replied, tossing his blade aside. “Thou art kindhearted... I wish that I could have been... like thee.” 

“Why would you want to be like me? I’m... a horrible person! I don’t even deserve the honor of slaying any of the Watchers, not even you!” I responded, though my voice was shaky. 

“The honor belongs to thee. Now... come forth, angel, and claim that glory, before any other,” Marekophix said, grabbing both of his blades He pushed Brutality into a notch on his wrist. “The glory is all thine, angel. Disregard all who say otherwise.” 

 

Marekophix closed his blades, thrusting them towards me. I couldn’t parry it, of course, so I dodged the strike.  

I swung my blade at him several times. I missed all my strikes, unfortunately. His unnatural appearance still unsettled me, but he was one of the kindest people I had met on my journey. Why was such an unholy creature even kind to begin with? 

Marekophix opened his blades and reached towards me, closing them swiftly. He cut off several of my feathers, but it barely hurt. I retaliated with a strike to his chest, creating another cavity there. The ribcage cracked, and Marekophix winced. 

The Puppet that Takes opened his blades again and swung them like any normal sword, creating a semi-circle of death. One of the machetes clashed with my katana, and the force was able to close them once more.  

Sparks flew and metal scraped, the sound piercing my eardrums. My heart was pounding and sweat ran down my forehead. Then, he swung his claws at my arm. 

His claws struck my forearm, causing me to loosen my grip on my katana. I staggered back, and his scissors pushed against my katana. Bloodlust whirled towards me, and the sharpened tip grazed against my cheek. Marekophix swung again, knowing that I couldn’t block this attack either. I stumbled backwards, regaining my grip on my blade. 

After Marekophix swung Bloodlust and Brutality, he paused for a moment to prepare himself for another strike. I took the opportunity to thrust my katana at his head, the blade piercing his flesh and opening another cavity in his already wounded body. Whatever bone he possessed there had broken, a jaw. Ichor spilled out again, but I couldn’t retract the blade in time. 

The rusted edge of Brutality struck my side at the same time I pulled out 761-TENSHI’s katana. A flood of pain fell over me, and tears fell down my cheek. I fell backwards and I dropped the katana in the process. I had never felt such pain before, and it felt agonizing. I put my hand to the wound, and my fingers came away aureate; I was bleeding again. There was so much ichor around me, and my mind raced with solutions, but none were good enough. It hurt so badly, but I couldn’t give up; despite being so tempted to do so. 

The ichor was everywhere, and I was getting lightheaded. I prayed that I didn’t pass out from blood loss; or worse, die from it. If I didn’t stop bleeding, I would be dead. All I could do was hope that the blood would stop bleeding soon. 

On the ground, I now understood why Marekophix was such a terrifying foe. At his impressive two-and-a-half-meter stature, he towered over me like a building. My heart was pounding faster than it ever had before, my breathing equally as heavy. And my pain was worse than I had ever felt before. He loomed over me, and I felt like being enveloped by the cold stone floor. 

But then, he closed his blades and reached out a hand. I gasped quietly, hesitating for a moment before taking his cold hands. His mind seemed so full of life, but his body lacked that spark. I could tell that only a little of his body was his own. 

I stood up, brushing myself off. Sweat ran down my forehead, and my clothes sort of stuck to my body. The wound was still stinging, but I knew I would live. Ichor was splattered everywhere, having dripped from my wound. 

Both of us caught our breath, unconsciously agreeing to be merciful during this short rest. After a moment, he nodded his head, indicating that he was ready again. I nodded as well and picked up the blade.  

“Is there a motive behind this clash?” the Songbird of Malign remarked, opening his blades again. I prepared to duck as he swung them, closing the blades in the process, but leaving his back exposed. I rolled behind him, and I got to see his back for the first time. His back had significantly less patches and seams; due to the constraints of the human form, but instead, a gnarled, crooked spine jutted out of his flesh. The bone was yellowish and scratched with age; it was a weak point. 

“I was tasked... with killing you and your fellow Watchers,” I answered as I swung the katana at Marekophix’s spine. He flinched, unable to move for a moment. I recalled that in humans, if a certain part of the spine were hit, it could potentially result in a stagger. And since Marekophix’s spine appeared to be a human one, this seemed to apply to him. “It’s repentance for an iniquity I did years ago... that I have no memory of.” 

After a moment, he replied, “Ah… how righteous. My brethren are twisted, certainly. They have fallen further from the Heavenly Father than I ever will... the Archbishop of Blasphemy expressly. Rumors say they still roam even decades after they were supposedly felled.” 

I really didn’t care who the Archbishop of Blasphemy was; unless they were one of the Watchers that I needed to slay. While I was climbing to my feet, Marekophix spun around, swinging Bloodlust and Brutality again.  

I quickly reacted by ducking and grabbing ahold of that broken string of chains again. I thrusted the chain towards him, and it caught around his arm. I grabbed ahold of the other end, pulling both sides harder. 

“Angel, cease!! I plead of thee!!” Marekophix begged. But I didn’t listen. I pulled the rusted chains further. The chains got caught on the shackle around his arm, and with enough force, Brutality fell right off. Marekophix scrambled, gripping the links with his claws and wrenching them off his arm. Then, before he could grab it, I took Brutality from the ground and put 761-AOTSS.SWR-TENSHI’s blade aside. I leaped into the air and swung the blade at the Watcher’s head. 

The entire upper half of his face was sliced clean off. He screeched in pain, the ichor spilling all over my face. His eyeball slid out of the socket. The flesh around his head fell loosely around his face, but some bits of muscle and tendon were nailed into his brittle skull.  

His skull was partially exposed now. I could see his bloody teeth which were previously covered by stolen flesh. His skull was hollow and incredibly brittle, and I watched as those teeth that were sprouting out of his head earlier all started to sprout from his hollow skull like weeds. Bloodlust fell out of his hand, leaving him without a weapon. 

He was completely blind now, and he thrust his sharp claws towards me rapidly, screeching like a banshee. His hand got caught on Brutality, and it was severed completely, the ichor spraying all over me and the floor. I kicked him over before he could injure me, knocking him onto the cold stone floor. 

I put 761-TENSHI’s katana to the Watcher of Envy’s heart, sighing. I thrust the blade into Marekophix’s chest cavity, piercing his ribcage. It would be over if I pushed a little further. “I’m sorry for doing this,” I said regretfully, sighing. I would have to kill him, I knew that. But I still hadn’t forgiven myself for whatever sin I had committed in the past. What would happen if I just thrust the blade further? 

 

Marekophix sighed, the ichor still dripping from his head. “End me. I... I wish to perish...” he repeated quietly,  

“Angel... cease for a moment, please,” he requested, his voice shaky. I nodded, pulling away the blade. I felt bad for Marekophix, after all. He was chained for a century, and there was nobody there to free him. 

Marekophix climbed to his knees, grasping around to find the severed half of his eyeball. A few feet away, it stared at me with its luminant yellow irises. “This cavern I dwell in... it is so cold…” he whimpered softly. He was so vulnerable, it was so strange. 

“Thy name... what is it, young angel?” he asked, grabbing ahold of his severed hand. He reattached it to his arm, pushing it into his hollow form. He clasped his hands and looked to the ceiling like he was praying. 

I hesitated, trying not to cry. “My name is... Azrael. I do not know... anything else.” 

The Watcher of Envy seemed to smile inside, somewhere in his body. “Azrael,” he repeated, rocking back and forth. “Such a beautiful name,” he continued. 

“And your name, Marekophix... what does it mean?” I asked, staring down at his body. 

“Marekophix... it means wilted flower. An exact description,” he chuckled, but there was nothing amusing about it. “The last petal will fall eventually.” 

He paused for a moment, “Art thou... afraid of the end? Do tell, and do not bother with lies. Deceits will not bring thee... any benefit.” 

My voice was shaky, but after a moment, I answered, “I am, yes.” 

“We carry the same burden... the horror of death,” he tucked his wings closer to his body, sighing deeply. “We are... so unalike, yet we share so much. I envy thee, Azrael... as I do all angels. Angels like thee are free... unshackled, yes,” he paused for a moment, turning his head towards me. “The freedom to choose who thou art...” he started, “is something I never felt. Stealing is all I have known for the eons I spent shackled beneath the city that I helped to create.” 

“Why did you take their bodies? What did you gain?” I asked, gazing down at his whimpering form. 

“The flesh... it gave me life. Unlike anything thou angels o’er the heavens provided. Never did I need the sprawling Roots of Eden; nevermore the tree spills the holy light upon me. Everything I could have wished for, in my hands... then they snatched it away. Beauty... my beautiful skin; stripped away from me as if I were a filthy demon. I had to steal to regain that splendor... I am nothing compared to what I once was. My eyes were green with envy as I broke away the flesh of man. I was reduced to the living carcass before thee. Humans... angels... demons... ye shan’t ever recognize the suffering that they forced me to endure.” 

“Maybe so... but that doesn’t change what you did. How did you end up as a Watcher? What blood is on your hands?” 

Marekophix chuckled, his teeth clacking against each other. “They delivered me to the skin of Gaia, where I was instructed to circulate with man, who perceived me as one of them. I taught humanity everything I knew about warfare, as I had been taught by my mentor. Had I never done such an act... I would never have been shackled by these holy chains. Humanity developed technologies even Lucifer would never wish to gaze upon. Humanity is not meant to have knowledge of how to develop such machinations ‘till two millennia after the death... of God’s only son.” 

“So you are responsible for the conception of the machines that patrol Babel... the ones that bleed the same blood as man... Who is this mentor you speak of?” 

The Watcher of Envy sighed deeply. “The late Watcher of War; the Third Watcher, cut down by the Murasama... the blade in thy hands is the very same katana that felled her. That blade is one of the only weapons that can slay Watchers like me.” 

I examined the katana closely. It was covered in glowing red symbols; likely the characters belonging to a foreign language. Forks of scarlet lightning branched out steadily from the cold steel. “So 761-AOTSS.SWR-TENSHI was... able to kill a Watcher?” 

He chuckled dryly, his hands searching for something on the ground. “Despite thy clever wits in battle... thy mind is dull. The Murasama was able to eliminate her, only in the hands of the sanctified. If the automaton were to attempt slaying her... its effort would fail sorrowfully. Only the angelic could cease her life.” 

“I see...” I said, staring down at Marekophix. He had given me so much knowledge, but who was to say whether his word was true? 

Marekophix held onto a rock he picked off the floor. “This stone has persisted for five eternities. No stone in this cavern is as aged; but none of them can think for themselves. I am this rock and the vines are thee. I have existed for forty decades... ten of which were spent bound to this hell. The body and blood of thee... ah. Forgive my error... thy body is older than I assumed.” 

Marekophix held up his eye after having found it on the ground. It stared at me, and somehow, Marekophix could tell how long I had lived just from looking at me closer. He could still see through his eye, and I had no idea how he did. 

“The heart entombed in thy body... it has existed since as long as the first humans were conceived. Older than any Watcher is thee. The memories thou once possessed were swept away by the waters of Lethe. It is under my impression that thy blood can be traced to the First Death; the Angel of Death that came before all others. He was the senior to Sariel, to Abaddon, even to Dumah.” 

This was an incredible revelation as to who I really was. I was present before Adam and Eve ate the Forbidden Fruit. That was thousands of years ago, at the very least. 

 

Marekophix sat hunched over on the floor, breathing deeply. “When my heart finally stopped, my body persisted. I reached past the shattered ribcage, grasping my angelic hands around her heart. I pulled it out of her bloodied body, her skin pale as the moon. Then I reached out for daggers... to carve out a cavity in my chest, rupturing my brittle bones and tearing out my old heart. I substituted it with hers... they locked me in hallowed chains in this blood clot in Gaia’s veins. For a century, I have waited for thee... to finally put an end to my miserable tale.” 

“You killed her,” I remarked, narrowing my eyes at the Second Watcher. “You’re no different from the rest of them. Watchers like you should be killed. You have mere minutes left, Watcher of Envy.” 

“The words that spill out of thy mouth are undeniably true. The city bled for me... I had never returned the favor. The beating heart of Babel lacks the plasma of my blood; held in veins wound around my brittle body. Her claws clasped around the heart that I... cannot call my own.” 

“Slay me and... and the people of this city will finally comprehend the actions of I, wicked and rotten... the actions of the chancellor, detestable and sickening... the actions of thee; praiseworthy and splendid,” he continued, clasping his hands tighter. I stood up, the tip of the Murasama meeting Marekophix’s heart. But he pushed it away. 

“Use... the Murasama... fragment me in two... Hell beckons for a soul... a soul that died eons ago,” 

I put the Murasama to his abdomen.. In his final breath, he said, “Taj’ka, I shall lay my eyes... upon thee... soon.” 

 

The warm ichor splattered on me as I heard him screech. But he didn’t yet perish. His arm reached up for me hopelessly, his sharp claws leaving a mark on my leg, cross-shaped. I placed my foot on his head and stomped viciously until he didn’t move. It was what he wished to happen. 

 The Watcher of Envy was dead, and I killed him. His glowing golden blood was all over my legs and my shirt, it was clear what I had done. I fell to my knees, weeping. My hands shook as I held the Murasama, tempted to use it again, this time on myself. My thoughts rang out in my head, trying to muse me into doing terrible things. The voices in my head grew louder, though I knew they were all mine. I wanted to thrust the katana into my own chest, but I shook my head; I had to keep going. The end didn’t need to be so soon. 

Hope was but a façade, but I could at least pretend to have faith. God must answer my calls eventually, I thought to myself, clasping my hands together and pleading to God, thinking He would answer. 

“Holy Father... please, answer my prayer,” I started, muttering a prayer that I barely remembered. 

“Lord, forgive me... please,” I whimpered, my voice shaky. I stared up at the stone ceiling, tears flowing down my face. God must be out there somewhere, right? 

I muttered incoherently, helplessly weeping. The corpse of Marekophix stood beneath me, his head viciously smashed in. I whimpered, “I... I’ll visit you when I go to where I deserve... the underworld beckoned for you, and I know it’s beckoning for me as well.” 

I swore I could hear the Watcher’s voice calling out to me, denying my iniquity. “Thy iniquity is nevermore,” the voice said, having lost its usual raspiness, smooth and oddly sweet. I was conflicted on whether what I did was righteous or not, and I knew I shouldn’t trust Marekophix. But what if he was right?  

I tried to reply to the voice, but there was no answer. He was right, I would never forgive myself for what I did. I couldn’t bring him back; I never really thought about what would happen when I killed him. 

I stood up, my tears unending. I stood over Marekophix’s corpse, and I reluctantly wrenched his shackle off his cold, stolen skin. It was rough, light, and rusty, but it was the only way I would be able to wield his blades. Even if his blades were incapable of harming a Watcher, I wanted to keep his blades, for a reason I did not know. 

I pushed it onto my wrist, my voice breaking. “Thank you... Marekophix.” 

 

I pushed Brutality into the broken shackle’s keyhole and turned the blade until it was locked into place. The ichor dripped off Bloodlust, a reminder of what I had done. 

I held the Murasama in my other hand as I walked back to the giant door. It was locked, but Brutality’s hilt was the same shape as the keyhole. I pushed the blade’s end into the keyhole, opening the door again. 

I tapped one of the elevator buttons, and at once, the door opened, for whatever reason. I walked into the elevator and leaned against the metal railing again. 

While I waited, I wiped off the ichor on my sleeve, staining the fabric further. I would need a change of clothes at some point. 

Then, the door opened. 

 

The Council was nowhere to be seen, except the Head Chancellor. Nimrod looked like he was sick. At the end of the table, he sat, staring at nothing. His weathered silver mask was placed to his right, his face finally exposed.  

His face was horribly deformed and his eyes looked weary. His condition was getting much worse. It seemed that Marekophix’s presence somehow alleviated the plague from spreading to other parts of his body, and now that the fallen angel was dead, it had finally reached the rest of his body.  

His skin was thin and almost pink, his eyes bloodshot. His nose had been reduced to slits, with bumps and sores all over the rest of his face, and the shape of his skull was clear. Even his hair had fallen out; he wore his cloak over his head to hide that fact. The crimson hood of his robes provided him a bit of comfort, knowing that his face was mostly obscured. 

His eyes slowly turned up to me, his hands trembling as he examined me. He noticed the ichor on my shirt, some of it mine and some of it from the stolen blood of Marekophix. Nimrod’s hands were bony, and he placed his hand on the table. 

“You’re a-alive... l-little rat... you don’t know what you’ve done,” Nimrod stated, placing his hand on the table, drumming his fingers. His voice was so raspy, and he sounded so old that it was hard to believe he was under fifty years old. 

“I know exactly what I did, chancellor. As Marekophix told me, the citizens of New Babel no longer think of you as a savior. They think of you as a coward,” I replied, sitting at the other end of the table. His eyes were so tired and so weary, I pitied him. 

Nimrod sighed deeply, “My pride blinded me. I never saw what the fallen angel was doing to me... this is not His doing. Heavenly Father... please spare me. The wounds are getting worse... so much worse. Lord, please forgive me,” Nimrod lamented, his back hunched as he felt his face for the sores and bumps. He looked so despaired, and I knew I was partially responsible. 

“Nimrod, if that really is your name... you fell for the fallen angel’s tricks. You might be a good person on the inside, but that won’t change anything. You are responsible for a war that will tear your nation apart. And you’ll never even see the damage you did,” I answered, blinking slowly. I watched as a tear fell down the man’s warped face. 

“I’m sorry... dear denizens of New Babel,” he whimpered, facepalming as he continued to weep. “The name of Nimrod belonged to the... the great hunter of legend. I do not deserve to share the name with him any longer. I have been reduced to a wicked, evil chancellor of a nation... t-that shall fall so soon. D-Do not call me by that name any longer.” 

I gulped nervously, but I wasn’t sure if he got the point yet. “Chancellor, do you know what the citizens of this city will do to you if you step foot outside the building?” 

The leper coughed violently, a few drops of his own blood spilling from his mouth. “Oh, I know what they will do, yes,” he remarked. “They don’t know what the Scourged One did to me. They’ll hold me accountable... a thousand lacerations shall fall upon me.” 

“This city bleeds for you. You were so blinded by the fallen angel that you never even thought to pay them back. The city gave up everything to worship you, and you never even showed gratitude. The eyes see clear, and death will not spare you,” I said. I started to stand up, holding Marekophix’s blades behind my back. 

“I will... l-let you decide my fate. How will you put me to rest?” The chancellor inquired, holding up his golden leaf crown and examining its beauty for the very last time. 

I hesitated. I wasn’t sure if I would let him die a peaceful death or not. After all, I didn’t know all that he did, and it wasn’t all his fault. I only knew what he did in the past few days. After a moment of silence, I answered. 

“I’m not worthy of deciding that. The people of Babel know what you’ve done, and I’m barely aware of your sins. They will decide your fate, Chancellor. If they spare you, you won’t live for much longer anyway. The disease has torn you apart. I’m sorry.” 

 

I stepped into the square again, glancing back at the Tower of New Babel. It stretched so high, but now it had no influence. Red droplets fell from the sky; the clouds were finally clearing. I reached out my hand to feel the rain, my mind almost incapable of thinking about anything besides Marekophix’s death and Nimrod’s illness. The rain was warm, very warm, and it looked like human blood. But it didn’t linger on my skin, it fell right off like water. 

The wound on my side had stopped bleeding, but my clothes were stained. I outstretched Bloodlust and Brutality, thinking about the other Watchers. What were they all like? What other hardships would I go through? Would I have to deal with more corrupt rulers like Nimrod? 

A familiar voice severed my thoughts, but it wasn’t Arael. 

 

“Azrael. Those blades... you did it, didn’t you?” Sariel asked, standing beside me. He was smiling as if I had done something amazing, with which I didn’t agree. He didn’t even notice the gash on my side. 

“The evil has been felled, Sariel. His ichor stains the Murasama... I can’t forgive myself,” I answered, placing my hand on my forehead as I felt the rain, or perhaps blood, fall on me. My hair became wet, and I grumbled. “And Nimrod, if he isn’t killed by the people of Babel, his illness will. His face was... hideous.” 

Sariel’s smile faded. He stared at my face, then finally noticed the gash on my side. He covered his mouth with his hand, in disbelief. “Azrael... you’re injured badly.” 

“I know that, Sariel. Marekophix is not to be underestimated,” I said, sitting down on a metal bench. “Bloodlust and Brutality... Marekophix told me I could have them.” 

“How peculiar... you don’t know his true intentions, though. He could have cursed those blades somehow.” 

I narrowed my eyes and grumbled, “He wouldn’t try to do that. He promised a just clash. He seemed like he was one to uphold his promise. 

“What’s up with you anyways? Ever since you lost your memory, you’ve been really... snappy.” 

I glanced back over at Sariel, displeased. “You’d be like this if you almost died of blood loss too,” I said, pointing to the cut on my side. 

“I would at least ask for help. But you don’t want help, do you, Azrael? You want to maintain this mysterious persona, don’t you?” Sariel teased, in a mocking voice. 

I had enough. I stood up and slapped Sariel in the face, but it was more of a suggestion, like ‘please don’t mess with me.’ 

“You... just slapped me? How... dare—” 

I put Bloodlust to Sariel’s chin, and he gulped nervously. “Okay, okay, I-I’ll leave you alone! God...” 

“Don’t use the Lord’s name in vain. And... I never said I didn’t need help, but I don’t think I want help from you if you act like this. Arael said you would help me get into the Tower, but you didn’t come. You were terribly late, of course,” I muttered, pulling away the blade. 

“F-Fine! I’ll be on time next time, I swear! You’ll find me in your next location!” Sariel exclaimed as a bead of sweat fell down his forehead. He adjusted his shoes and stood up. 

“And where is that? Will that place also leave me wounded like this?” I asked, narrowing my eyes at Sariel again. 

“That would be the Colosseum, it’s on the outskirts of Babel. Then, after that, you can enter the labyrinth. It is also quite dangerous, b-but I’m sure you can make it!” 

“And who is the Watcher in the Colosseum?” I asked and started to walk away. 

 

“The Tenth Watcher; The Watcher of Wrath; Gositriv... The warrior who bears no weapon.”
